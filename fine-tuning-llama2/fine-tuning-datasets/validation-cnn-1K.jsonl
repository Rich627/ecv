Residents in the city has been complaining to the local government over a lack of public restrooms, leading downtown alleys and side streets to become rank with the smell of urination. Just last year, local police issued 550 misdemeanor citations for public urination and only 40 per cent were given to the homeless. Scroll down for video . Rude: Denver residents are complaining over a lack of public restrooms in the downtown area. In addition to a lack of public restrooms, many business only open up their bathrooms to paying customers. Above, a stern sign outside one downtown business . The issue is not only because of a lack of public restrooms, but also businesses who only open up their bathrooms to paying customers - going so far as to hang up stern signs like 'No pay. No poop. No pee.' In an op-ed for the Denver Post, retired journalist Dennis Ryerson cites suburbanization for the lack of free toilets. He says that when immigrants were first moving to downtown Denver a century ago, the city installed several 'comfort stations'. But as new building codes required businesses to provide restrooms for workers, and more people began to move to the suburbs, the restrooms were closed. No place to go: A Denver Public Works spokesman said the city is looking into solutions for the public restrooms issue . Heather Burke of Denver Public Works says the city is aware of the issue and is looking to rectify it. 'It's definitely on the city's radar; we have a working group that's looking at different options for public restrooms,' she told KDVR. 'There hasn't been a big need for it in the past but we're looking into it now because we've heard from the community that there is a big need for it,' she added. However, the speed of addressing the issue has Ryerson concerned. 'Denver has installed dog parks in my neighborhood and others. We are taking care of the dogs. Why can't we address a basic element of human health and sanitation?' he writes. 'Other cities, from San Francisco to New York, Calgary to El Paso, Victoria, B.C., to Philadelphia, are beginning to address the issue. Not Denver.

Because had they done so, we would have had major catastrophe,\" President Beji Caid Essebsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. A third museum attacker remains at large, Essebsi said. Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. Essebsi told Amanpour 15 arrests had been made since Wednesday's attack, in which 23 people were killed. Most of the victims were foreigners and 19 were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. Essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of ISIS who had been trained in Libya. This echoed comments made by Tunisia's Security Minister Rafik Chelly on Friday, who said two attackers had been given weapons training at Libyan camps and had been activated from sleeper cells. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The message said the group had targeted \"crusaders and apostates\" with \"automatic weapons and hand grenades\" in bloodshed that was \"just the start.\"  CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. An uncle of suspect Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. He said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. \"It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,\" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters.

'I know my daughter and she is not one to make up stories or lie, so eventually I took her to see a dentist.' There, Ana, from the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, was diagnosed with a rare form of oral myiasis. This is a fly lava maggot infection that grows in humans and animals. 'I couldn't believe it when they said she had a disease and then started pulling the maggots out,' said Ms Cardoso. 'I thought I was going to be sick.' A spokesman for the dental surgery said: 'There were 15 maggots in her mouth so we videoed the removal for our records as it is a rare occurrence. 'We also wanted to show the girl's family what had happened and warn others.' The video shows Ana's reaction as a surgeon in white gloves takes out one maggot at a time with a pair of tweezers. Ms Cardoso said: 'She was actually very calm throughout the whole process but I suspect that was more out of helplessness. 'I mean, what else could she do?' Myiasis comes from the Latin word 'myia' meaning fly and 'iasis' means disease. The flies' larvae can feed on the host's living or dead tissue, liquid body substance, or ingested food. When the tissues in the oral cavity are invaded by parasites, this is known as oral myiasis. Those at risk of the rare condition include those from poorer social backgrounds and people who have suffered wounds or other injury to the face. It is also more common in regions with a warmer climate. Infestations of the nose and ears are dangerous because of the possibility of penetration into the brain, the fatality rate is 8 per cent in such cases.", "completion": "response:\n\nAna Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil's capital, Brasilia .\nHad complained of tingling sensation in gums and things 'moving around'\nDentist was shocked to discover fly lava maggot infection inside her gums .\nCalled oral myiasis, it had caused 15 maggots to form in her mouth ."}

The actor and director was due to appear in court today after he was charged with affray and possession of a long-bladed sword near his home in east London, but was too unwell to attend a hearing. Police were called on the evening of January 6 to reports of a man armed with a 'machete'-style knife who was said to be threatening members of the public in Bethnal Green. Deacon, who shot to fame in the gritty film Kidulthood, did not appear at Thames Magistrates Court this morning because he was too unwell after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, the court heard. The court clerk said: 'This case was adjourned, I believe, on the 6th March and if you look at the charge sheet, the charges concern allegations from January 6 of affray and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. 'On the last occasion the defendant wasn't in court and an adjournment period was agreed because the defendant was in hospital for treatment for underlying mental health issues.' Emek Yagmur, defending Deacon, passed a letter from the hospital the actor is receiving treatment at to the court . She said: 'He is now back in their care and he has not been released because he is not well enough to attend. He has been sectioned under section two [of the mental health act]. 'We are asking for a six-week adjournment. He is clearly not very well.' The hearing, which lasted a matter of minutes, was adjourned to April 30.

'We're judging Manchester City as champions of the Premier League. There has to be progression year on year, you have to get better. But this team, we keep seeing the same mistakes being made' Prior to the Liverpool game, questions had been raised over Pellegrini's decision to play with two strikers and leave his midfield exposed. With flair players David Silva and Samir Nasri also not fulfilling their defensive duties, the Chilean's bold selections appeared to have signalled some oversight. And in the post-match analysis, Carragher offered his opinion: 'To employ that system (4-4-2) in the big games is so naive. It's embarrassing really for a manager at that level to go into a game against Barcelona two years running and then again at Anfield like this.

Asked if he expects to play again this season, Ibe said: 'Yes, hopefully. It was the ligament on the side of my knee and they said I could be out for six to eight weeks, but everything has gone smoothly from here and hopefully I can crack on now and get back in action. 'They (Liverpool) have not said anything to me yet but if I can just keep doing my rehab in the gym and in the swimming pool I can get back to training quickly.' Ibe controls the ball during the Barclays Premier League match against Everton at Goodison Park . Ibe uses his pace to get by a Southampton defender during the clash at St Mary's Stadium . Liverpool will look to pick themselves up after defeat to Manchester United when they travel to Arsenal next weekend and Ibe believes Champions League qualification is still in their reach. 'Hopefully we can get top four or even higher. Although they have lost a game they are still on a high. We need to keep building from there and picking up points.

But it seems it is now about to become a blessing, as baby hair is one of THE beauty trends for this summer. As championed by the likes of FKA Twigs, Katy Perry and Rihanna, the short fluff around the top of the forehead is becoming a key accessory. FKA Twigs regularly makes a feature of her baby hair . Katy Perry wore slicked down baby hair at the Givenchy show last month, while Rihanna is also a fan . The style is worn gelled down on the forehead, styled into curls and wavy tendrils. The cutting-edge pop stars aren't the only ones using the style though - several top name designers have also been using their look in their catwalk shows. In February, Riccardo Tisci sent his models down the runway at the Givenchy show with wet look baby hair. The Caitlin Price show at London Fashion Week also used the look, but in a more other-worldy manner. Model's at the Givenchy show in February sported baby hair and facial jewellery . The look also appeared it he DKNY SS15 show and last month's Caitlin Price show in London .

No!’ said Guardiola. ‘If I have to face Messi, I want it to be in one game rather than two!’ If they do happen to face each other in Berlin — and after Friday's draw it is not wrong to expect Barcelona and Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat.

Before, the definition said marriage was between \"a man and a woman.\" The new definition says, in part, that \"marriage involves a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman, to love and support each other for the rest of their lives.\" Already, PC (USA) ministers can perform same-sex marriages in states where such marriages are legal, the group said. But no teaching elder or session can be forced to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies if they do not believe they are appropriate. Not all members supported the decision. In a post on PC (USA)'s website,  Jean and Robert Gorney accused the church of going against the Bible and threatened to leave. \"We are not to change the Bible,\" their post said.   \"I don't care who disagrees.\" But the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, which says it supports \"a fully inclusive church,\" welcomed the news Tuesday night. \"The change aligns the church's constitution with a reality that has long been true: Both same-gender and opposite-gender couples have been living in relationships that demonstrate covenant faithfulness, shared discipleship and mutual love,\" the group said. \"We are also aware that the discussion has been a difficult one for many, and that some will feel a deep sense of pain over this decision.

And finally on Monday negotiations concluded with Simeone’s sister and agent, Natalia, over a new deal that extends his current commitment to 2017 by three years and raises his annual net salary to £4.4m. Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has signed a contract extension at the club until 2020 . Simeone has pledged his future to Atletico for the next five years, with the aim of building an empire . The contract includes a clause allowing him to leave at the end of a season for reduced compensation . All but confirming he had received offers from other clubs Simeone said: ‘I have chosen to stay here because the club is growing. 'It is strong and that fills me with enthusiasm. In life it is difficult to choose sometimes but I am sure about the decision I have taken.’ Confirmation of Simeone’s loyalty to the club where he won La Liga last season will disappoint a clutch of Premier League clubs interested in his services but the deal is believed to include a clause that would allow him to leave for a reduced compensation package if he did so at the end of any given season. Atletico Madrid are now 20 per cent owned by Chinese corporation Wanda and Simeone has been told money will be available in the summer without the need to cash in on top players as in previous seasons.

The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. The expression of the mother is priceless. The photo was taken in October by USGS scientist William Link. Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups. He confirmed Friday that the adult seal was the baby's mom. It's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo, but Link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed, \"so this Mom was pretty relaxed,\" Link told CNN Friday. \"I have a great shot a few seconds later where Mom yawned hugely. She looked utterly content, to me.\" The agency's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media. As the Instagram caption notes, the Weddell seals of Erebus Bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years. \"Because of its isolation, this population is undisturbed by human activities. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics.\" Link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close. \"I was awed,\" he said. \"It's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions. It's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold, high winds, no life to be seen except for the seals, an occasional skua or an emperor penguin.\" After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals. \"Mom doesn't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned, and even then doesn't get to eat. So while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds, Mamma loses about twice that much,\" he said.

Germany has signed an agreement to return to its rightful owner an Henri Matisse painting that was seized under Nazi rule. Matisse's 'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' was part of a trove of artworks found in the apartment of late collector Cornelius Gurlitt. Experts say the painting was taken from art dealer Paul Rosenberg and rightfully belongs to his descendants. Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed a report in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today that she signed the agreement. A similar agreement was signed last week for a painting by Max Liebermann. Both agreements must be approved by a Munich court handling Gurlitt's inheritance. A Swiss museum that accepted Gurlitt's bequest of his collection has promised to ensure any Nazi-looted pieces are returned to their Jewish owners' heirs. Around 250 artworks were found in Gurlitt's Salzburg property. Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern inherited the collection . Some 1,280 others found in Gurlitt's apartment in Munich. While some of the Munich works were already known, it was the first look for many at the art Gurlitt kept in the house he owned in Austria. It includes works by Breughel, Monet, Renoir and Picasso. Gurlitt inherited much of the art from his father, who in the 1930s helped the Nazis sell art they considered 'degenerate' to buyers outside of Germany for cash. Some of the works — including Impressionist and modern masterpieces — had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell.

In a written statement to the House of Commons, Mr Fallon said that the UK's gift came in response to a request from Kiev for help with basic equipment, supplies of which have been depleted by months of instability caused by Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. Mr Fallon said: 'This Government is committed to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. As a result of their prolonged engagement in this conflict, the Ukrainians face a serious shortage of basic equipment, and have requested help. 'Our proposed gift of non-lethal equipment is designed to prevent further Ukrainian fatalities and casualties and to help improve situational awareness on the ground.' And he added: ' Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its destabilising activities in eastern Ukraine, including  direct military support to the separatists, have demonstrated its disregard for international law. 'The latest ceasefire agreement, reached in Minsk on February 12 and which came into force on  February 15, has seen a reduction in violence in the conflict zone. We very much hope it will help  end the conflict. 'However, fighting has not ceased in some areas and there continues to be  fatalities and casualties amongst the Ukrainian armed forces.' The gift comes after Kiev asks Britain for help with basic equipment.

In the lawsuit Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz say Bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face after he complained about the pop star driving his Ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in Calabasas, California. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also alleges Bieber's bodyguards dismissed Jeffrey Schwartz's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with \"what are you going to do about it, Jew boy?\" The suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. Representatives for Bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon. The lawsuit comes after Bieber, 21, pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a January 9, 2014 incident in which the Schwartzes' house was pelted with dozens of eggs. Bieber agreed to pay $80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years' probation. It's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol, who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his ATV collided with a minivan last August in Canada. Thursday's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of \"offensive\" behavior by Bieber and members of his entourage from March 2013 to January 2014. The Schwartzes, who lived next door to Bieber, claim the harassment escalated after a March 27, 2013 episode in which Bieber spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face and threatened to \"f---ing kill\" him. The following year, after the egging episode made headlines, the Schwartzes say they and their children were subject to \"constant harassment\" by Bieber's entourage, fans and the media. The couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Bieber sold the Calabasas house for $7. 2 million last year to Khloe Kardashian and has since been renting a $60,000-a-month home in Beverly Hills, according to Forbes.", "completion": "response:\n\nTwo former neighbors of Justin Bieber file lawsuit against the pop star .\nSuit alleges he vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them .\nBieber, 21, pleaded guilty last year to a related vandalism charge ."}

Doungal, a police official in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. \"There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,\" Doungal said, referring to the mobs involved in the incident. The suspect was accused of raping a local  woman last month. Since the attack,  tensions have grown between the native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district, police said. Thousands of protesters demanding cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex  Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack,  according to authorities. \"We retrieved his body before it could be hung,\" Doungal said. Dimapur town has been placed under a curfew. \"The situation is still volatile,\" he said. India made international headlines this month when it banned a documentary  showing an interview with a convicted rapist, who blamed his victim and said she \"should just be silent and allow the rape.\" Outrage has grown following the incident, which gives a window into the violence against women in the nation. The woman in the documentary incident was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012. She later died from her injuries, sparking an outcry worldwide.

Woods, a former world No 1 whose ranking has plummeted to 96th, has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour and said he would not return until his game was 'tournament-ready'. Woods, the 14-time major winner, has struggled to find any form this year . 'As far as Augusta is concerned ... it's literally a 50-50 chance right now from what I can tell,' Begay, who played with Woods on the Stanford University golf team, told digital network 120 Sports on Wednesday. 'That's far better odds than what it was, say, three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, I would have said there was maybe a 1-in-10 chance of him playing at Augusta.' Woods has not competed since he withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open early last month after 11 holes because of tightness in his back, and is still adapting to the fifth swing change of his career. Woods is currently on an indefinite break from the sport but aims to qualify for the 2016 Ryder Cup . He missed the Masters at Augusta last year for the first time in his career after being advised by doctors to have back surgery and his participation this year is in serious doubt given his struggle for form and fitness this season. The 14-time major champion posted the highest score of his professional career as he carded a mind-boggling 11-over-par 82 to miss the cut at the Phoenix Open in January, and many pundits believe he is suffering from the chipping 'yips'. However, Begay, a television analyst with Golf Channel, believes Woods is now settling into his new swing under the supervision of consultant Chris Como. Tiger Woods struggled for form during the Waste Management Phoenix Open back in January . 'It was good for him to take a step back, to reassess a variety of different things and do things on his timeline,' said Begay, a 42-year-old Native American golfer who won four times on the PGA Tour. 'My suggestion to him was to take as much time as he needed to just figure out this issue with his short game and also to work on or clean up a couple of things that might be a little loose with his golf swing. 'Any transition, any change that you are making mechanically, takes a little time to settle, so that's what he's done. We've had some good discussions over the last week or so and he feels good about it.'", "completion": "response:\n\nInjury-hit Tiger Woods has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour .\nWoods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open early last month .\nFormer world No 1 has seen his ranking plummet to 96th ."}

Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside, even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters. Instead, the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises. Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch Friday's solar eclipse amid fears they could be blinded . The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres. The decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by Cardiff Council. The memo advised schools  to read a leaflet from the Royal Astronomical Society on how to observe an eclipse safely. Advice in the leaflet states that 'the sun is so bright that just looking at it can blind you, so you'll need to prepare beforehand'. A council spokeswoman said: 'We are not telling schools they should not allow children out. 'We have left that decision to the schools. We are providing schools with a copy of the Royal Astronomical Society's advice.' Cardiff Council sent advice to schools from the Royal Astronimical Society, explaining how the eclipse can be watched safely. Pictured: A solar eclipse in the Faroe Islands . It goes on to state 'there are various ways to observe it (the eclipse) safely, using both everyday materials and telescopes or binoculars'. These can also include eclipse viewers, colanders, pinhole viewers, and mirrors. It is believed the schools were left to provide the equipment themselves. A second school in the area, Fairwater Primary School, said it would not be making any changes to the school day to accommodate the eclipse. Meanwhile, Bryn Hafod Primary School, also in the area, said it needed to do a 'health and safety assessment' before it would make a decision on whether to allow children to watch the eclipse. During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse. Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole.

But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt. The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match. But Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie any chance of hitting a six. Scroll down for video . It was a single bowl that triggered a massive uproar at the time when Aussie bowler delivered an underarm . As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust. Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash. Despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time, it was deemed 'an act of cowardice' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost New Zealand the tournament.

Xu, who passed away at a hospital on Sunday, became one of the highest-profile figures in China's military to be caught up in President Xi Jinping's war on corruption last year, when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations. The court decided not to prosecute Xu due to his illness, but said his illegal income, including the bribes he was determined to have accepted would be handled in accordance with the law. Formerly a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, the body which runs the two-million strong PLA, Xu was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and had his rank of general revoked, according to a statement from the state-run Xinhua news agency. A seven-month investigation, which began in March last year, found that Xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people. He confessed to accepting bribes personally and through his family. He was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members. The amount he received was \"extremely huge,\" the statement added. In Chinese President Xi Jinping's annual New Year speech, he reiterated China's \"zero-tolerance\" stance towards corruption, vowing to keep \"waving high the sword against corruption\" and \"fastening the cage of regulations.\" 2014 saw Xi take down two top officials in China's fight against corruption, in addition to Xu. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang, likely soon to become the most senior Chinese official ever to face corruption charges, and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao.

Bidding to win their first ever knockout match at a World Cup, the Proteas bowlers removed both openers inside the first five overs and never eased up the pressure thereafter. Duminy (3-29) dismissed Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews (19) with the final ball of the 33rd over and returned to send back Nuwan Kulasekara (1) and ODI debutant Tharindu Kaushal (0) with the first two deliveries of the 35th. The ninth World Cup hat-trick left the 1996 champions reeling at 116-8 after the loss four wickets for just two runs in three overs and when Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed soon afterwards, the writing was on the wall. Sangakkara, who had been looking for a fifth successive century, scored a measured 45 from 95 balls but was forced to throw off the shackles as the wickets tumbled around him and holed out to deep third man off paceman Morne Morkel. A heavy shower appeared out of the blue as if to mourn what looks like being the final one-day innings of one of the game's great batsmen and the players came off the pitch for a 23-minute rain break. It only delayed the inevitable, however, and Lasith Malinga (3) was the last man to depart, hammering the ball to David Miller at cover off South Africa's other main spin threat Imran Tahir. Tahir took 4-26, including the wicket of Mahela Jayawardene to leave another retiring Sri Lanka batting great with a tally of four runs in his final innings in the 50-over format. Sri Lanka, who won the toss and chose to bat, were never able to score at a pace that would have put pressure on the South Africans and test their mental resolve.

The country's president Ernest Koroma has ordered everybody to stay at home between now and Sunday in an effort to halt the spread of the killer disease. Sierra Leone had a previous nationwide curfew in September at the height of the epidemic. Scroll down for video . Sierra Leone residents have been told to remain indoors until Monday in an effort to halt the spread of Ebola . Almost 25,000 people have been infected with the killer disease, pictured, which has claimed 10,000 lives . The Christian Examiner reported President Koroma's remarks, urging his people to work together. He said: 'The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake, . 'I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together. The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone.' According to the World Health Organisation, there were 33 confirmed new cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone in the week of March 22. The WHO said that that one-third of these cases were in the capital Freetown. As healthcare workers on the ground battle against the spread of the disease, two experimental vaccines against Ebola are now undergoing clinical trials in Liberia. A total of 600 people are being inoculated against the disease. Confirmed Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, pictured, seemed to be clustered near the country's west coast . An estimated 12,000 people have been infected by Ebola in Sierra Leone, pictured . The country's six million population have been told that the curfew could eliminate the disease from the country. Thousands of teams will fan out around the country, knocking on doors to remind people how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it. In the hot spots — the regions around the capital and in the north — health workers will also search for Ebola cases. Alfred Palo Conteh, the head of Sierra Leone's Ebola response, says a major goal of the campaign is to fight complacency, more than a year after the outbreak was declared in West Africa. Ebola has infected nearly 12,000 people in Sierra Leone. In total, almost 25,000 have been infected with Ebola during the current outbreak claiming the lives of more than 10,000 people.", "completion": "response:\n\nPresident Ernest Koroma has ordered the curfew until Monday morning .\nHealthcare workers hope this will stop the spread of the killer disease .\nAlmost 25,000 people have been infected claiming more than 10,000 lives .\nTwo new vaccines are being tested in neighbouring Liberia ."}

Opening ceremonies in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kick off Saturday in Anchorage. When the race begins Monday, mushers will cross the starting line in Fairbanks instead of Willow, the traditional starting point. It's the second time in the race's 43-year history that the starting point has moved from Willow to Fairbanks because of weather-related issues, an Iditarod spokesperson said. The first time was in 2003. While cities across the northeastern United States have seen record snowfall this winter, Alaska received less snow than usual. Anchorage collected only 20 inches of snow this season, compared with a seasonal average of 60 inches. Race organizers made the unanimous decision in February to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas, and \"therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race,\" Iditarod Chief Executive Stan Hooley said in a press release. While snow has fallen east of the Alaska Range over the past couple of weeks, other parts of the trail did not get much or any of it, Hooley told CNN affiliate KTVA-TV in February. The racing course spans a 1,000-mile trail across the Arctic tundra, ending in Nome. The race usually takes 10 days to finish, although Dallas Seavey finished the race in 2014 in a record time of eight days, 13 hours, four seconds, and 19 minutes. The lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the Pacific to the region, said meteorologist  Dave Snider with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. \"It's the same weather pattern that brought the east coast such snowy and cold weather this season.  Alaska was simply on the warmer side of this weather pattern,\" he said. Warm sea surface temperatures along the Alaska coastline are another reason for milder conditions, he added.", "completion": "response:\n\nAlaska's famed Iditarod race starts Saturday .\na lack of snow forces the starting point to move 225 miles north .\nWarm air from the Pacific has affected weather conditions in Alaska ."}

And if you mark pi at 9:26.53 in the morning or night, you're just a little more in line with the celebrated irrational number that never ends. To 31 decimal places, pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795. A few more tidbits about pi and Pi Day: . About pi . Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It's not equal to the ratio of any two whole numbers, so an approximation -- 22/7 -- is used in many calculations. Pi is essential in architecture and construction and was used frequently by early astronomers. Pi has been known for about 4,000 years, but it started to be called by the Greek letter only in the 1700s. The origin of Pi Day . Pi Day started 27 years ago at San Francisco's Exploratorium. Physicist Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, started celebrating pi on March 14, 1988, primarily with museum staffers. The tradition has grown to embrace math enthusiasts from all walks of life. Celebrations . This year, the Exploratorium is hosting a day-long celebration at its facility on Pier 15, including a Pi Procession, servings of pie and a pizza pie dough-tossing event. Pi Day is also Albert Einstein's birthday. In Princeton, New Jersey, where Einstein lived for more than two decades, signs of the scientist permeate the Pi Day festivities, from birthday parties at the Historical Society of Princeton to an Einstein lookalike contest. Plus the requisite pie-eating, pie-throwing and pizza pie creation. For more about pi, visit www.piday.org.

Retired British army chief General Richard Dannatt suggested there was ‘no-one else’ for the US to turn to in Europe. It comes days after a UK think tank predicted that up to 30,000 British service personnel could go leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade. Retired British army chief General Richard Dannatt (pictured) suggested there was ‘no-one else’ for the US to turn to in Europe . Now there are fears the United States could be left without a credible partner as it stands up to a number of global security threats. Lord Dannatt, who served as Chief of the General Staff between 2006 and 2009, told the Washington Post: ‘If the UK can’t do it, who else is the US going to turn to in Europe? There’s no one else.’ He added: ‘The concern is that we’re going to fall from being a significant player to a bit-part player. ‘The UK isn’t of much use to the US if we don’t have a worthwhile military force behind us. Anybody can talk tough. But if you don’t back it up, everyone just laughs at you.’ The comments come a week after the US Army chief of staff General Ray Odierno revealed he was ‘very concerned’ about cuts in the British military. A UK think tank predicted that up to 30,000 British service personnel could go leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade (file picture) Earlier this week, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, warned of a ‘dangerous’ gulf emerging between American and European spending on defence. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that governments in Europe needed to spend more and that cuts around the continent were ‘concerning’. A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of Britain’s forces face redundancy over the next parliament. It comes as Prime Minister David Cameron faces calls to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over. It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts.", "completion": "response:\n\nRetired British army chief General Richard Dannatt says there is 'no-one else' for US to turn to in Europe .\nComes amid fears 30,000 British personnel could go by end of the decade .\nUS army chief of staff General Ray Odierno ‘very concerned’ about cuts in the British military ."}

The Russian President had been due to make a visit to Kazakhstan this week but an official there said it had been cancelled because he was ill. Mr Putin also failed to appear at an annual meeting of high-ranking officers from the Federal Security Service today, an event he has attended in past years. Scroll down for video . Last public appearance: Vladimir Putin with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Russia last week . It was claimed the crisis over Ukraine and murder of an opposition politician may have caused a collapse in Mr Putin's health. But another theory, advanced by the lawyer of murdered Boris Nemtsov, was that the strongman may be lying low because he is 'afraid' of an assassination bid. Rumours: The Ukraine crisis may have contributed to a collapse in Putin's health, it has been claimed . Putin loves to be seen as an ever-present action man, but the Russian president has been absent from public view for a week. The 62 year old's unusual absence has dented his tough-guy image. His aides scrambled to explain he was healthy and his macho handshake remained so strong 'it breaks your hand'. Putin was last seen in public when he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 5 March. Official pictures have emerged of meetings since then, but rumours say these in fact took place earlier before his sudden and unexplained disappearance. Nemtsov's lawyer claimed Putin may be scared over the high profile murder yards from the Kremlin, suggesting the Russian leader maybe in hiding fearing an assassination bid. 'Perhaps Putin, even completely sincerely, was bewildered and even afraid,' said Vadim Prokhorov. 'Because if you can do that next to the Kremlin, then is it not possible to do it along the route of the presidential motorcade?' Spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the health speculation over Putin as 'spring fever'. The leader was 'holding meetings all the time' to solve the 'crisis'. 'There is no need to worry. Everything is fine,' said Peskov, not explaining why Putin did not make an appearance to disarm the rumour-mongers. The spate of speculation over his condition recalled regular health scares over his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and a clutch of geriatric Soviet leaders.", "completion": "response:\n\nPutin's visit to Kazakhstan was cancelled because he was ill, official said .\nHe also failed to appear at annual meeting of high-ranking officers today .\nClaimed Ukraine crisis may have contributed to collapse in his health .\nPresident was last seen in public when he met with Italian PM last week ."}

A former middle school math teacher from Pennsylvania has pleaded guilty to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students last year. Jessica Streeper, 34, a married mother of two from Doylestown, entered the plea Monday in Montgomery County Court to a felony charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Judge Garrett Page postponed sentencing until the defendant undergoes a sex offender evaluation and the probation office completes a background report. Streeper was a teacher at Eisenhower Science and Technology Leadership Academy in the Norristown Area School District. Prosecutors said in a criminal complaint that an eighth-grade student told them he had sex with Streeper last spring in her car and in her home. The disgraced educator could face a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison. She is currently out on $10,000 cash bail. Prosecutor Sophia Polites said it would be 'appropriate' to sentence the former educator to prison time, reported the Bucks County Courier Times. ‘Teachers are entrusted with the responsibility of teaching our children, making sure our children are safe,’ said Polites. ‘Teachers are role models. What this teacher did was destroy that trust.’ Wife and mother: The married mom of two admitted last year to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and sexting with him from her phone . Jessica Streeper was arrested in May 2014 after police in Norristown received an anonymous tip informing them that the eighth-grade math teacher was having a tryst with a male student. When the alleged victim, then age 14, was interviewed by detectives, he admitted to having sex with Jessica Streeper on seven occasions, including five times in her car. When investigators checked the teenager's cellphone, they found numerous 'sexts' that were exchanged between the married teacher and her underage lover. According to the criminal complaint, the illicit affairs lasted between April 1 and May 20, 2014. During Monday's court hearing, Judge Page informed the defendant that as a registered sex offender, she will have to report her address and place of employment to state police for the rest of her life.

Libya's internationally recognized government has blamed \"ISIS militias\" for the attack Friday in which the Al-Ghani oil field was set on fire. The kidnapped foreigners were working for VAOS, an Austrian-owned oil services company whose headquarters are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. They include four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghanaian, according to the Philippine foreign ministry. The Bangladeshi government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage. The nationality of the ninth worker was unclear. The abductions come amid Libya's deteriorating security situation in which Islamic militias, some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group ISIS, have thrived. Egypt carried out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya last month after the killings of Egyptian Christians who had been kidnapped while working in a Libyan city. The Philippine foreign ministry said Monday that its Tripoli embassy had \"stepped up coordination\" with the Austrian company and Libyan authorities \"to locate the abducted Filipinos and ensure their safe and immediate release.\" Martin Weiss, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry tweeted Monday that \"credible sources\" had confirmed that the Austrian citizen and other international workers were in the hands of ISIS \"terrorists.\" The attack on Al-Ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in Libya. The Libyan National Oil Corporation said over the weekend that it had warned VAOS more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns. VAOS wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. The Philippine foreign ministry said 52 other Filipinos are employed by VAOS but were relocated out of Al-Ghani \"much earlier\" and are now in Tripoli. Three other Filipinos have been missing in Libya since they were seized at the Mabruk oil field in February, the foreign ministry said. \"These cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of Filipino oil workers in Libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose.

It may be unimaginable that you won’t be able to call friends ‘Gazza’ and ‘Babs’ in the future, but according to latest research these once popular names are no longer being used for the next generation. According to OurBabyNamer.com the name Gary reached peak popularity in 1952 in the US, coming in at number nine on the baby names popularity list where there were 38,000 registered Garys. However, in 2013, only 400 babies were thought good enough to be called Gary. Legendary actor Gary Cooper was the flag-bearer for his Christian name in the 1950s . In another name shocker, Nameberry.com revealed that Barbra, spelled in the same unique way as global superstar Streisand, was also out. Streisand made her unusually-spelled, condensed name famous in the 1960s, when it peaked at Number 511, only to drop off in the Top 1000 in 1971. To make matters worse the conventional spelling of Barbara, a Top 10 name for three decades, only just gets in the Top 1000. So no matter how you spell it the name seems a goner. Barbra Streisand made her unusually-spelled, condensed name famous in the 1960s . Other names compiled by baby naming website Nameberry.com that look on the way out are Llewellyn as a boy's name and Claudine for a girl. The popularity of the 2013 Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis obviously has not rubbed off on cinema-goers. A common name in Wales, with the distinctive Welsh double-l beginning, Llewellyn appeared on the US list for six decades. Bye bye Baby: The girl's name Claudine is another one that has gone out of fashion . But despite its rich Welsh history, literary cred and quirky nicknames, Llewelyn doesn't cut it any more.

A man who broke a baby's arm and leg through  'reckless cruelty' has been spared jail. Doctors said the infant's broken leg may have been caused by Josh Campbell 'yanking' it out of its cot, while its broken arm appeared to be the result of a 'forceful rapid rotation injury'. But Campbell, who has anger management issues, denied yanking the baby, telling the court he had lifted it out its cot by its arms. At Newcastle Crown Court, the 20-year-old pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of 'reckless rough handling'. He was allowed to walk free from court after he was handed a suspended sentence. Michael Hodson, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown are opening the case on the basis of rough handling and reckless behaviour. 'The Crown say there was not deliberate pulling in order to hurt the child, but an impatience to get the child to do what the defendant ignorantly thought the child ought to be able to bear. 'It's clear the defendant has a short fuse and can be an angry individual who has a problem with his temper, especially when drunk. 'When he was told about the injuries he became very silent and dropped his head.' Newcastle Crown Court heard how the baby was taken to hospital because it's right arm was not moving freely and X-rays discovered fractures to the arm and leg. Campbell from South Shields, who admitted child cruelty, was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Robert Adams told Campbell: 'You accept you were too rough. The child suffered two separate fractures. 'I accept that you bitterly regret this, it is clear from your letter. You were 19 at the time, you are now 20, have clearly grown up and are determined to put this behind you. But the 20-year-old denied yanking the baby's leg at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) and pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of 'reckless rough handling' 'I don't consider you are a dangerous offender and sending you to immediate custody is going to achieve very little in this case.'

Instead of lashing the ball into a corner and hoping his accuracy beat the dive of the goalkeeper, he tried to chip the ball down the middle and into the goal - a panenka penalty kick.

Balde's contact with the ball was so light it only trickled to goal, despite the goalkeeper diving the wrong way .

As the ball was stopped inches in front of the goal line, Balde reacts to his error for Benfica . Balde wa substituted and his Benfica side  drew to Shakhtar 1-1 before losing the game on penalties . The skill is named after Antonin Panenka's penalty at Euro 1976 for Czechoslovakia against Germany but Balde lacked all of the conviction that made Panenka's kick famous.

The 56,300-ton warship, which was launched in 1956, was decommissioned in 1993 but kept in storage for possible reactivation until March 2004 when it was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it and turn it into a museum. But attempts by groups in Long Beach, California, and Fairview, Oregon, to do so came up short of meeting U.S. government requirements for donation. The Long Beach group called itself Top Gun Super Carrier in reference to the Ranger's role in the 1986 Tom Cruise movie. The carrier was used for interior shots in the film, which also featured appearances by the carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Enterprise, according to Internet Movie Database. In December, the Navy paid International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, a penny to take the carrier off its hands. The shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap. The Ranger, which left Bremerton on Thursday, follows two of its predecessors in the Forrestal class of carriers -- the Forrestal and the Saratoga -- to scrapyards in Brownsville. Another carrier, the USS Constellation, part of the Kitty Hawk class, was towed to Brownsville last year. Like the Ranger, the Constellation was stored in Washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of South America, as it would not fit through the Panama Canal.

The 22-year-old is a product of the Premier League champions' academy - having joined in August 2008 before signing a professional contract at the Etihad Stadium in 2012. Johansen, a Norway Under 21 international, came on as a second half substitute in two matches for New York City during pre-season - first against Brondby and then in a Carolina Challenge Cup clash against Houston Dynamo. New York City announced the signing of Manchester City goalkeeper Eirik Johansen on Tuesday . 'I had a great experience working with squad and coaches during the pre-season and I'm excited to re-join the team on permanent basis,' Johansen told the New York City's official website on Tuesday. 'The quality of the training really impressed me, as did the way the team came together in such a short period of time.'

'We had a good look at Eirik over the course of the pre-season, and he adapted well to the team and to our style of play,' he added.

With his team leading La Liga and on the verge of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Manchester City, Pique took time away from training to interact with his fans. When asked who were the best defenders he has played alongside, the 28-year-old listed a pair of stalwarts from the two clubs he has signed for during his career: Carles Puyol at Barcelona and Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United.

Pique arrived at Manchester United from Barcelona's La Masia academy as a teenager in 2004 before returning to Barcelona four years later when opportunities at Old Trafford became limited, primarily because of the established form of Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. The Spaniard, who has a child with pop songstress Shakira, bears a similar cultured style to Ferdinand in the mould of a tall defender with excellent technique who is comfortable on the ball. Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, Pique again chose one player from England and another from Spain when asked who have been his toughest opponents.

The patient received breast augmentations, hormonal treatment and facial surgery to appear more feminine in her mid-30s.

Elway has been aggressive in free agency in the recent past and the Broncos used the franchise tag and $12.823m on wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. Speaking at last month's combine, Elway addressed Manning's legacy. 'I do think that the one thing he can add is another Super Bowl championship. I think with where Peyton is, as I told him in our meeting, I said, \"You don't have to throw for another yard and you don't need to throw for another touchdown pass because your legacy is going to be one of the all-time greats as it is as we sit here now.\" Where he can really add to his legacy is to win a Super Bowl. I think that's our goal, as it is for 31 other teams, but we feel like we've got a real good football team and Peyton Manning is the best player for us.' Following the departure of former head coach John Fox and offensive coordinator Adam Gase to Chicago, Manning will now start afresh with new head coach Gary Kubiak and OC Rick Dennison.", "completion": "response:\n\nManning will receive $15m in wages for the 2015 season - a cut of $4m .\nManning, who turns 39 this month, will make up the shortfall through perfomance incentives .\nThe first pick of the 1998 draft will head into his 18th NFL season chasing an elusive second Super Bowl ring ."}

The former Motherwell manager has been put in charge until the end of the season. The decision to replace caretaker Kenny McDowall, who has now left the club, is the second major upheaval at the club in the space of a week following Dave King's boardroom coup last Friday. Stuart McCall has been named Rangers manager until the end of the season . McCall, like the club's new board, is a man the Light Blues faithful can trust following his trophy-laden stint as Rangers player during the mid-90s. But the 50-year-old does not believe the former regime, backed by Newcastle United owner Ashley's millions, would have welcomed him through the front door on Edmiston Drive so readily. He said: 'I don't think I'd have been offered the job if the new regime hadn't come in. 'I had a chat with John Gilligan yesterday and Paul Murray late last night. It was a whirlwind. 'I'm delighted for the people in charge of the club because I know how much it means to them. I'm delighted for the supporters because that is what they want.

'You could turn things around slightly, get to the play-off final, get your goalie sent-off after five minutes and then lose on penalty kicks. These are the thin lines between success and failure.

Dame Maggie Smith, whose tart-tongued Lady Violet Crawley has most of the best lines on \"Downton Abbey,\" caused a fuss this week when she implied that her beloved character won't be around much longer. \"I mean, (my character) certainly can't keep going,\" Smith told the Sunday Times. \"To my knowledge, I must be 110 by now. We're into the late 1920s.\" No more Dowager Countess?!? You could almost hear the genteel wails of protest on both sides of the Atlantic. The speculation about Smith was hurriedly squashed by a \"Downton\" publicist, who said Smith, 80, has agreed to stay with the series \"for as long as the show runs.\" But that didn't stop rumors about the demise of \"Downton\" itself from continuing to crop up. Smith even hinted during her interview with the Times that the next season of the hit show would be its last. \"They say this is the last one, and I can't see how it could go on,\" Smith let drop. Creator Julian Fellowes is developing another period drama, \"The Gilded Age,\" for NBC and has been noncommittal about how much longer the show might endure beyond season six, which is filming now. \"It won't go on forever -- I'm not a believer in that,\" he told The New York Times in a recent interview. \"But I can't immediately now tell you where the end will be.\" It is hard to imagine \"Downton,\" which just wrapped its fifth season on PBS in the United States, without the wit and wisdom of Lady Violet, whose acerbic commentary leaves few around her unscathed.

On Thursday evening, thousands of people who were demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers, tore into the prison complex and pulled the suspect out.

'As people started adopting them, my mom thought it would be a good advertisement for the remaining kittens to have a little photo-shoot.' The kitten in the picture was the wildest out of the litter, but was eventually adopted. Ritter kept one of the cats, whom he named Sophie. The photo came about when Ritter and his mom, Austin-based artist Barbara Atwell, decided to use a dollhouse Ritter's great-grandfather had built by hand many years before. 'It's quite the amazing piece of carpentry,' Ritter said. 'It even has a working light system.' Users on Reddit were as impressed by the dollhouse as they were amused by the photo.

Despite Alves wearing headphones and giving every indication that he had no interest in talking to the press, the questions kept coming.

Moss, from Belton, Missouri, said she was outraged when Kylee came home from Hillcrest Elementary School last Friday with a letter from her physical education class stating that her body mass index was too high for her weight and height. ‘She is tiny. She has no body fat at all,’ Moss said of the slender, bespectacled second-grader. Scroll down for video .

Lifestyle tips: The note made recommendations for more exercise and healthier snacks . The note also included recommendations for more physical activity and healthier snacks. The mother told the station KMBC when Kylee read the note on the bus, she instantly became concerned about her weight and body image. ‘She goes, “Does this mean I'm fat?” and I said, “No, this does not mean you are fat,\"’ Moss recounted. The parent said the school should have sent the note home in a sealed envelope to avoid making children feel self-conscious. Heidi Hicksam, whose 10-year-old son, Kaleb, also attends Hillcrest Elementary, was equally despondent when she got the note indicating that her son's BMI was above average. Hicksam said to Fox4KC Kaleb suffers from a liver disease, and the family did not need a letter reminding them of his health struggles. Students at Hillcrest elementary School in Missouri recieved the notes last Friday after being weighed in and measured by PE teachers . Body mass index is calculated by multiplying a person's weight by 703 and dividing the result by the height. Age and gender are factored in when determining BMI parameters. According to a chart included in the note from the school, a 7-year-old girl's healthy BMI should fall between 13.5-17.5. Kylee's index was 17.9. 'They send home a piece of paper that says, \"Here is a box. Your child doesn't fit into it. Here is what you should do to fit into the box,\"' her mother fumed. Belton Superintendent Andrew Underwood said the letters are sent home to parents every year to promote a healthy lifestyle as part of a county-wide program called Healthy Hillcrest. Underwood insisted that it was not the school's intention to be malicious towards students.

Despite Real Madrid's poor run of form, which has seen the fans turn on some of the players and the management, Alcaraz knows that on their day they are more than capable of beating his side.

Joanna Leigh claims the indictment is retribution for her vocal criticism of the way One Fund Boston disbursed the funds. Authorities say Leigh, 41, collected almost $40,000 from One Fund and other sources after claiming to have suffered a brain injury during the attack. They say she received $8,000 payment from One Fund Boston, which was set up to compensate bombing victims. She's also accused of receiving $1,700 from a school fundraiser, collecting more than $9,000 in contributions from an online fundraiser and getting more than $18,000 in benefits from the Massachusetts Victims for Violent Crime compensation fund. The indictment says she also accepted free medical treatment. No one is contesting that Leigh was at the marathon on April 15, 2013, the day of the attack. But Boston Police and Suffolk County investigators say she wasn't hurt. She apparently did not claim any injury or seek any medical treatment until about two weeks later. \"When she did begin to make those claims, she billed herself as a 'hero' who ran toward the second blast,\" authorities said. Leigh says the indictment is payback for her criticism of One Fund. She and others have claimed they weren't properly compensated by the fund because of the way it calculated payments. If someone's injury didn't require an overnight hospital stay, he or she received $8,000. Those who were hospitalized got $125,000 or more. \"I don't think this is about me; I think this is because I spoke out about The One Fund,\" she told the Boston Globe on Thursday. \"I think this is about killing the messenger.\" Leigh will be arraigned Monday.

Is it OK for a patient to choose to spend his or her final days on this mortal coil in what would amount to a medically induced coma? Or is it simply euthanasia in disguise? Members of the French Parliament offered resounding support Tuesday for the proposition that is should be permissible for doctors to induce sleep until death in terminally ill patients who are in pain. They approved a bill allowing that by a vote of 436-34. There were, however, 83 lawmakers who declined to vote -- a measure of just how contentious the issue has been. The bill goes now to the French Senate. Should it become law, doctors would be allowed to administer \"deep sedation until death\" to terminally ill patients who request it, and for whom palliative care would not ease the pain. The law would also allow doctors who have stopped life-saving measures to administer deep sedation, if they deem it appropriate, to terminally ill patients who are unable to give their consent. \"Everyone has the right to a death that is dignified and soothed,\" the proposed law says. And health professionals, it continues, should \"implement all the means at their disposal to fulfill this right.\" What the law entails, according to Jean Leonetti, the member of Parliament who proposed it, is simple: \"Sleep before death to avoid suffering.\" What it also entails is legal protection for doctors who, in fact, already sedate some dying patients, and who are sometimes taken to court by relatives as a result. Euthanasia is illegal in France, though President Francois Hollande promised in his 2012 campaign that he would reopen the issue. Polls show that more than 90% of French people support the proposal -- an astonishing majority for any proposal -- and Hollande has said it  would represent a big step forward. But, as might be predicted, the proposed law has proved divisive in the extreme. Some lawmakers on the left of the political spectrum said in advance they would abstain from Tuesday's vote because they thought the bill did not go far enough toward legalizing euthanasia. And some on the right said they, too, would abstain, because they saw the law is a way of legalizing euthanasia in disguise.

But could the ornate splendor of the UK's Houses of Parliament be about to offer a solution to London's housing crisis? In all honesty, probably not. However, that hasn't stopped housing campaign group, Generation Rent, from proposing to transform the Palace of Westminster into affordable new homes. The group's eye-catching idea is to move the seat of British democracy from one of London's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of Hull, northern England. The vacant House of Commons and House of Lords (the UK's upper legislative chamber) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the River Thames. According to a press release on the proposal from Generation Rent, 335 MPs from all over the UK currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively. They claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer £5.26 million ($8 million) in 2013 alone. By moving the seat of government to Hull, a city with the cheapest housing rent in England, millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs, the group claims. Westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in London, according to research from house moving firm, Delivery Quote Compare. The ever-rising cost of property in the UK capital, meanwhile, is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city. A January report from rental referencing company, Homelet, also found that average rental prices in Greater London were more than double that of those found in the rest of the UK . \"We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis,\" said director of Generation Rent, Alex Hilton. Yet even if the Generation Rent proposals were seriously considered, they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, said Monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to £3 billion ($4.6 billion). A 2012 study entitled \"The Restorations and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster\" found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks, repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos.", "completion": "response:\n\nUK campaign group proposes to transform Houses of Parliament into affordable housing units .\nWestminster is one of the most expensive boroughs of London for buying or renting property .\nParliament could require restoration work totaling $4.6 billion ."}

A study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill and researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse . After tracking 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010, the American team found that divorce levels were roughly the same between healthy couples and those in which the husband suffered sickness. But when disease hit the wife, the likelihood of divorce rose. Every two years the researchers interviewed the couples and asked whether either of them had been ill since their last session. Over the 18 years, 859 marriages ended in divorce, 32 per cent of the sample group. For 24 per cent of the couples, tragedy struck when one spouse died, and 44 per cent were still going strong by the time the study ended. But among the 965 couples in which the woman got sick, the rate of divorce was 6 per cent higher. Lead author Amelia Karraker, assistant professor in family studies at Iowa State University, said illness can add stress to a marriage because men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role as women. ‘There is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you,’ she said. ‘That’s something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage. If your spouse is too sick to work, we know that financial strain is a major predictor of divorce.’ Dr Karraker said wives may also become dissatisfied with their husbands’ ability to look after them. She added: ‘Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what is important in their lives. ‘It could be that women are saying, “You’re doing a bad job of caring for me or I wasn’t happy with the relationship to begin with, and I’d rather be alone than in a bad marriage.”’ The research was published in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe study monitored 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010 .\nResearchers say some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse .\nLead author says 'men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role'"}

Abdelrahman has a network of activists on the ground in Syria. On Saturday, the observatory -- citing an Assyrian commander -- said that ISIS planned to release 29 Assyrian Christian hostages. ISIS captured at least 220 Assyrians, all Christians, on February 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of Tal Tamer in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory said Saturday that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release, citing an Assyrian commander. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. The Syrian Observatory said its information indicates ISIS has taken the hostages to the Mount Abdelaziz area, southwest of Tal Tamer. The founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, Osama Edward, puts the number of Assyrian hostages at more than 262. Edward is based in Sweden but has family in the area that was attacked, and says his information is from the network's team on the ground. The number of hostages has climbed steadily, from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on Monday to 150 as of Wednesday, with women, children and the elderly among them. The number of people executed by the terrorist group has also climbed steadily. Since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June, ISIS has killed 1,969 people, the Syrian Observatory said Saturday. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

Three major characters -- Superman, Wonder Woman (both of DC Comics, a Time Warner company, like CNN) and Archie Andrews -- came out with new looks (and costumes in two cases) Thursday. Superman and Wonder Woman are no stranger to change over time, but these are pretty different from what we're used to. Wonder Woman is back to wearing pants (similar to her style circa 2010, not to mention a brief time in the 1970s) along with something of a turtleneck and body armor. Superman looks the most casual that we've ever seen him, simply in a t-shirt and jeans, and decidedly shorter hair. He also looks like someone you might not want to come across in a dark alley. As for Archie (who never really died, by the way), he's getting ready for his promised TV show by debuting a modern look -- one that makes it much easier to see why Betty and Veronica have been fighting for his affections all of these years. It's been a whirlwind time for comic book fans, and there will be a lot to get used to.", "completion": "response:\n\nSuperman, Wonder Woman and Archie all debuted new looks Thursday .\nThree of the most well-known comic book characters of all time look radically different ."}

U.S. calls to Cuba have typically been put through by companies in other countries like Italy and Spain. But now an agreement has been signed  that allows Americans and Cubans to make direct phone calls. Etecsa, Cuban's state telecommunications company, said the change would make calls easier and more affordable. President Barack Obama, pictured at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba. A direct telephone line between the two countries has been re-established for the first time in 15 years . 'It contributes to providing better infrastructure and better communications quality between the people and our two countries,' it said. The move marks a historic shift in U.S policy, which aims to bring an end to half a century of Cold War tensions. The lines were originally cut after American phone companies refused to pay a 10 per cent tax on calls between the two countries. But President Barack Obama declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba in December, announcing the re-establishment of diplomatic relations as well as economic and travel ties with the communist island. At the time he said: 'Isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach. 'We will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests.' Around two million Cuban-Americans are thought to live in the U.S. and many families rely on phone calls to stay in touch. Bill Pereira, CEO of Etecsa, said: 'We hope that this is the beginning of something, of a relationship that will allow us to build and grow and facilitate and ease communication between family members and loved ones.' Havana residents use public phones to make calls in December 2000. The Cuban government cut off direct telephone service from the United States to Cuba, although Cubans could still call the U.S. Residents are hoping that the step forward will lead to other services becoming available. Less than a quarter of Cubans, whose average wage is $20 per month, currently have any type of internet service. Virtually all home connections remain illegal and getting online at government centres is very expensive, as they charge between $2.50 and $4.50 an hour. Obama set connectivity as a priority in the United States' new relationship with Cuba, making telecommunications equipment, technology and services among its first priorities.", "completion": "response:\n\nCalls previously had to be put through by companies in other countries .\nChange should make calls easier and more affordable for residents .\nHistoric shift in U.S. policy as Obama declares end to 'outdated approach'"}

Zephany means \"hidden by the Lord,\" a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence. South African Police have been mostly quiet about the case. A police spokesman, Andre Traut, confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl's biological mother. Zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a Cape Town hospital in 1997. She is 17 and in her final year of school. In fact, according to local reports, that's how she crossed paths with her biological parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse. According to the South African Press Association, an independent news agency, students at their second daughter's school unknowingly solved the kidnapping. The second daughter, who was born four years after Zephany was kidnapped, started eighth grade at a Cape Town school this year, according to SAPA. Fellow students told her there was a girl in her final year of school who looked just like her, the news agency reported. The two girls became friends, according to SAPA, and eventually, Morne Nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter's new friend. He, too, was taken by the similarities and contacted the police, SAPA reported. A DNA test was done, and last week police arrested the 50-year-old woman who had raised Zephany. The woman made an initial appearance before a judge who ruled that she would remain behind bars at least until her next hearing. The shocking revelation has no easy conclusion. While Zephany's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her, for now, the girl is in the custody of the social services. The Nurses have been allowed to visit Zephany for short periods, South African media reported. And on Tuesday, Zephany herself released a statement, via the Centre for Child Law, which is representing her. \"I want to say thank you to all the people who supported me through this, for continuously praying and never giving up on looking for me,\" she said. \"Under the circumstances, I am doing fine.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nCeleste and Morne Nurse's baby was stolen from the hospital in 1997 .\n17 years later, their child has been found ."}

Austrian third division side FC Pinzgau have decided to try out a rather strange technique to practice their spot-kicks. Players were tasked with scoring from 12 yards after having spun their entire body around 20 times. Players were made to spin around 20 times before taking their shots from 12 yards . The unique penalty practice resulted in several hilarious failed attempts as players fell to the ground . The rationale behind this exercise is unclear, but one could assume that if a player can take a penalty while dizzy, then he can probably manage it in a game. Right? What followed was hilarious. Unsurprisingly, a number of Pinzgau players failed to score with their attempts and some even to make contact with the ball, instead landing bottoms up on the turf. This player doesn't even make contact with the ball before he goes crashing into the turf . After falling over twice more, he eventually manages to get his shot away and scores in the open goal .

This was not the case recently in Sri Lanka, when a drunk man in a national park decided to antagonize an elephant as horrified onlookers stood by. Video of the encounter shows members of the crowd shouting at the man to leave the elephant alone as it had killed a person only days earlier. The man lies down on the grass before the elephant as onlookers warn it has recently killed someone . After getting up and continuing to antagonize the creature, it suddenly runs out of patience .

But ignoring their pleas, he begins taunting the angry creature by first lying down on a bank directly in front of it. Despite the increasingly urgent cries from the crowd, he gets up and climbs down the bank until he is standing  in front of the animal. Suddenly, it loses its temper and rushes towards him. He falls over and is trampled by it before it almost immediately wanders away disinterested. The drunk man is then pulled up the grassy bank and it appears as though part of his ear has been torn off and his once-muddy shirt is left covered in blood.

Sharper's Las Vegas attorney, David Chesnoff, appeared Friday before a Las Vegas judge on two sexual assault charges stemming from allegations that he forced sex on two women in January 2014 while they were incapable of resisting. Details of the Las Vegas allegations weren't immediately available. Scroll down for video . Former NFL safety Darren Sharper appears in Los Angeles Superior Court (file photo) Sharper carrying the NFC championship trophy in 2010 as a member of the New Orleans Saints . Chesnoff declined to comment on the charges but said Justice of the Peace Janiece Marshall set another court hearing for April 3. Each count carries a possible sentence of 10 years to life in Nevada state prison. Sharper, 39, is sought on a warrant in Las Vegas, but he has been jailed since Feb. 27 in Los Angeles, where he was due for a preliminary hearing Friday after pleading not guilty to drugging and raping two women in 2013. He faces rape allegations in New Orleans, where he's accused of sexually assaulting three women in 2013. He has also been indicted in Arizona on charges he drugged three women and sexually assaulted two of them in November 2013 in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. Sharper is also under investigation in Florida for sexual assault. Exact details of the Las Vegas case have not yet been made public, but they are likely similar to the other three cases in which after a night out he would allegedly take a woman or women home who later reported they believed he served them a drink mixed with an illicit substance.

The Prime Minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the General Election. However, last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high. David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ is no longer taken seriously by the Office for Budget Responsibility . Home Secretary Theresa May later insisted the Tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to Government. But yesterday the OBR heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction. In a document published alongside the Budget, it said its previous forecasts had been ‘underpinned by the assumption’ that net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – would be 105,000 by 2019. Theresa May said Tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power . It stated: ‘A reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the Government’s declared efforts to reduce it.’ But in a blow to Mr Cameron, it added: ‘In light of recent evidence, it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply.’ Instead, it said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’. On taking power in 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to bring the politically-sensitive net migration figure below 100,000. But last month the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Downing Street described the figures as a ‘disappointment’ but also a reflection of a growing economy. The highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in September 2010. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” pledge on net migration is in complete tatters; not even the Office of Budget Responsibility believes the Prime Minister’s promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken. ‘If you needed any more evidence that this government simply can’t be trusted to deliver their promises on immigration, this is it.’", "completion": "response:\n\nPM promised to reduce net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ by the election .\nBut vow was shattered when figures last month showed it hit record high .\nTheresa May then vowed to cut number to 100,000 if Tories stay in power .\nBut OBR said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’"}

Shiveluch, which has been erupting consistently, caused a similar incident in January, he said. The airline will only operate flights when it's safe to do so and will not fly into areas of reported ash.

So luckily for this father, a pair of raccoons took it upon themselves to make his job a little easier by giving a little demonstration in the garden. The hilarious footage captured in Seattle begins innocently enough with some excited children looking out of the window at two raccoons scaling their fence. The children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden . As the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence – before a little ‘muffin man’ song interlude – one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other. One child, sensing the tension, asks: ‘Can raccoons fight?’ While another exclaims: ‘Woah, they’re wrestling.’ As one raccoon mates the other, the children begin to laugh and the father responds quickly be saying: ‘They’re doing more than wrestling I think.’ Laughing along in the excitement, the father continues to film the episode in the garden until one of the children offers up an explanation in the form of a question: ‘Is he doing the Heimlich manoeuvre?’ The children laugh hysterically as the two raccoons begin mating and offer up a number of innocent explanations for their behaviour . ‘I think so,’ replies one of the children before the father confidently states: ‘Yes, that’s the Heimlich.’ Raccoons usually mate between late January and mid-March, in a period triggered by increasing daylight. During the mating season, males spend much of their time searching for females in an attempt to copulate in the three-to-four day period when conception is possible. The encounters can last over and hour and may be repeated over several nights, so it is likely that the children have some laughs still yet to come. The Heimlich manoeuvre?

Spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a cardinal in charge of St Peter's Basilica, which Michelangelo also helped to design, had been offered the documents for 'a certain price'. Rome newspaper Il Messaggero said the person, described as a former Vatican employee, had asked for 100,000 euros (£72,000). The Vatican said a cardinal was sent a ransom demand asking for £72,000 to return two letters by Renaissance master Michelangelo (pictured, St Peter's Basilica, which the artist helped to design) This is the first time the Vatican has acknowledged the theft of the two letters, one of which supposedly contains Michelangelo's signature. Lombardi said the cardinal 'naturally refused because these are stolen documents'. He added that a nun who worked in the Vatican archives informed officials back in 1997 that the documents had gone missing, but he did not say why the Vatican had not disclosed the theft before. While the newspaper spoke of only one letter signed by Michelangelo, who lived from 1475 to 1564, the spokesman said two documents had gone missing. He added that Vatican police were now investigating the case with their Italian counterparts. No further details have been given about either of the documents, which were taken from the archives of the Fabbrica di San Pietro which looks after the upkeep of the basilica. The demand is believed to have come from a former Vatican employee. Until a spokesman confirmed the threat, it was not known that the documents had been taken back in 1997 . However, The Times reports the signed letter is believed to discuss art commissioned by the Pope. The archives contain numerous documents concerning the history, design and construction of vast holy site. The basilica took more than 100 years to build and was completed in 1626. Michelangelo took over the construction of the basilica in January 1547, while in his seventies, after the death of Pope Paul III's preferred candidate, Giulio Romano. Drawing on the complex plans laid down by a chain of architects before him, Michelangelo brought them together into a workable model, and is responsible for much of the basilica as it stands today.", "completion": "response:\n\nVatican says it was sent demand by man believed to be a former employee .\nNun reported that the letters, one of them signed, were missing in 1997 .\nBut until yesterday the public knew nothing about the letters being taken ."}

It is not known where or how he met his young wife, but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the EU without a visa. A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU (file picture) Because of these fears, he 'folded' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to Nice, in southern France. At Terespol station, on the border between Poland and Belarus, the woman was found by immigration officials, who immediately arrested the couple. After searching the suitcase, Polish customs spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'The Russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside.' There were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way, however it became clear that she was fine. Mr Sienicki added: 'She was in good shape and wasn't in need of any medical attention.' Despite this, the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls, which is a criminal offence. The newly-married couple were on their way back to Nice (pictured), France, when their bizarre ploy was rumbled . The wives of men with EU passports can  travel wherever they like in the EU, so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem.

The couple had risked a three-year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control. Mr Sienicki said: 'This was the first time I've seen someone travel like this.

Nick Clegg yesterday handed over £150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks. The Lib Dem leader’s generosity to the handful of Cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months. Yesterday’s handout brings Coalition spending on attempts to revive Cornish to £500,000 – enough to give nearly £900 to every person who speaks it. The Deputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls. It comes a week after the party announced a drop in fuel prices that mainly benefits areas full of Lib Dem voters. The 5p cut on fuel duty covers 17 rural areas, 14 of which are Lib Dem seats. Three of Cornwall’s six MPs are Lib Dems with slim majorities and Mr Clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the Commons on the day Chancellor George Osborne presented his Autumn Statement in December. Mr Clegg said: ‘I am determined to keep [Cornish] alive and thriving. ‘Great efforts have been made to revive and return Cornish to common use. It would be a crime to let such a distinct language disappear again.’ Cornish has not been widely used since the 18th century. At the 2011 census 557 people listed it as their first language. Last April, Lib Dems persuaded the Council of Europe to recognise Cornish people as a ‘national minority’ in England, which means the Government is now pledged to ‘combat discrimination’ against them. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I don’t know what the Cornish is for a blatant electoral bribe, but with £150,000 of taxpayers’ money I’m sure that Nick Clegg can tell us. It would appear that Mr Clegg is trying to buy votes with public money.’ The money will go to the Cornish Language Partnership, an organisation financed by taxpayers and run by activists and local council nominees. Mr Clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to ‘keep the lights on’. He confirmed he was prepared to stay on while coalition talks are hammered out, which could take weeks or months.", "completion": "response:\n\nLiberal Democrat leader’s generosity to handful of Cornish speakers is latest in series of extraordinary gestures to county over recent months .\nHandout brings Coalition spending aimed at reviving Cornish to £500,000 .\nDeputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls ."}

Ramsey was left out of the starting XI for Arsenal's Champions League exit to Monaco last week and he feels there is more competition than ever for places in Wenger's in-form side. 'There’s definitely a fight for our places,' he told Arsenal Player. 'Everyone is keeping each other on their toes - it’s good that we have that strength in depth now.'

Gesell, 17, from St. Charles, is accused of breaking into the home in November . Three teen burglars stole ashes after mistaking them for cocaine - and only realized after they tasted them. Devin M. Gesell, 17, is accused of breaking into the home in St Peter’s, Missouri,  in November with two others - a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old who can not be named for legal reasons. The trio thought they had come across a stash of cocaine and took it from the house along with a necklace worth $500, a Xbox 360 game system,  bottles of prescription drugs oxycodone and morphine, and over $800 in cash, reports the St. Louis Post- Dispatch. But when they tasted the ashes, which were in a wooden box, they realized their mistake - and threw the homeowner's father's ashes out of the car. Gessel later told the police they could not remember where they threw them out so police have not been able to retrieve them. According to police, the three knew the family who lived at the home and planned the burglary after seeing a Facebook post which indicated they were going to be away. But they were caught after police tracked them through an IP address used on the Xbox. Gesell was charged this week with burglary and two counts of theft. He told police he acted as lookout as the other two went through the house after breaking in through the back door. His bail is set at $10,000 cash-only. His accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were referred to juvenile authorities for charges. Debora Matthews, the victim of the robbery told Kmov.com: 'I just couldn't believe that they would take the ashes.'

Murray was largely untroubled by Young who struggled to force the Scot into unforced errors . It was a comprehensive enough performance, although there was the odd lapse of concentration against a player whose own level tends to undulate sharply. Murray raced to a 4-0 lead but was cut back to 5-4 as he briefly struggled with his movement. In these heavy and windy conditions he was too solid for the American left hander and ultimately cruised through after having to fend off break points in the fourth game of the second set. Murray said after the match that he was pleased with his performance and, in particular, the way he handled the windy conditions. Murray and Young shake hands after the straight sets win to put the Scot into the third round . Murray, who now plays hard hitting Colombian baseliner Santiago Giraldo, said afterwards: ' I've played well against him the last couple of times.

The heat was okay. The wind obviously cooled you down a little bit when you were at the end changes. Sometimes it can be ridiculously hot, and that makes managing the points and your emotions important. So I just tried to play smart, and it worked.'

The alleged incident occurred on a 93-degree day in late June 2014. Police say they reviewed footage from the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch after the little boy's mother complained he came home with blisters on the bottom of his feet. Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, a teacher at the center, claimed the infant didn't participate in outside activities at the school's 'waterpark' - a cemented area where sprinklers run -  because he was not wearing the proper shoes. However the cameras showed otherwise, according to The Herald-Tribune. Charged: Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, has been accused of neglect for letting a one-year-old boy in her care play outside on a hot summer day without shoes or socks on, causing second-degree burns to his feet . The boy can reportedly be seen leaving the classroom without shoes on. While he doesn't appear to have entered the waterpark area, he was playing on a paved walking that lead to the area. The footage then shows him returning to the classroom 30 minutes in Gomez-Garrido's arms crying, kicking and grabbing his feet. Gomez-Garrido can be seen attending to the child, looking at his feet at least twice, before putting shoes and socks on him. She can then be seen placing him on a seat, where he remained for the rest of the afternoon. Police say the boy ran from the classroom at 1.42pm and was picked up by his mother at about 4pm. Gomez-Garrido told detectives a few days later she did not let him play outside. However she  later admitted that she was unable to tend to the infant because she was supervising other children in the waterpark and was the only teacher assigned to the area that day, according to WTSP. Scene: The alleged neglect occurred at the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch in late June 2014 . An investigation however determined that Gomez-Garrido knew the toddler was playing on the hot surfaces outside and did nothing about it. Police say the child needed medical attention, with his burns determined to be second-degree, and that she failed to noitify his mother. Gomez-Garrido is charged with neglect of a child without great bodily harm.

Among the characters there is Donny, who is referred to as ‘Big D’ in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit, apparently. And Connie who doesn’t like it when men grunt and snort while laughing. Sporting a pair of over-sized glasses and a moustache, one man says: ‘If you don’t believe in love at first sight, let me reintroduce myself,’ before giving a little smirk. While a hipster-looking type stares down the camera and says: ‘I once made love in the sewers of New York City.’ Complementing the characters are some wonderfully coloured backdrops and some state-of-the-art fades between shots. Looking for love: Connie explains that she does not like it when a man grunts or snorts when laughing . The commercial concludes with Donny stating: ‘When I start nibbling on this sucker,’ while stroking his earlobe, ‘it’s game over,’ as the introductory music returns. According to CBC News Nova Scotia, the company were going to use real footage from the 80s but instead used actors to deliver the lines. The original video, which has gained much attention, has been viewed over 120,000 times on Youtube and people have commented such things as: ‘Well played, Halifax. Well played,’ in appreciation. Oversized glasses, terrible hair and creepy moustaches feature throughout the advert to give it an authentic 80s feel . And according to Downtown Halifax Business Commission, the advert has been a commercial success too. Commenting on their site, they wrote: ‘Our date night packages are sold out! But that doesn't mean you can't have a great night on the town in Downtown Halifax. ‘Who knows, maybe you'll run into Big D or Connie. They love it here. And they have great taste.’ Brightly coloured backdrops and state-of-the-art fades between shots feature throughout the commerical .", "completion": "response:\n\nVideo features creepy moustaches, terrible clothes and 80s music .\nCharacters include 'Big D' Donny and picky old lady 'Connie'\nActors play the parts of the singletons desperately looking for love ."}

But one West Australian farmer decided to see the lighter side of a torrent of rainwater that fell on his property on Sunday. Jordan Lynch, who owns a grain farm four kilometres east of Merredin, readied a surfboard, skiis and camera in an opportunistic bid to go 'skurfing' - a hybrid of surfing and water skiing-on the freshly formed lake, reports ABC. Jordan Lynch  took a surfboard, skiis and camera down to the freshly formed lake after heavy rains on Sunday . The farm had received 60mm of rain, causing the creek to overflow, a highly infrequent occurrence. 'I've only seen it flow twice before in my life, in 16 years, so I thought you can't miss an opportunity like that, so I grabbed my surfboard an my ski and gave it a go behind the four wheeler' he said. Mr Lynch said skurfing typically involves the rider being towed by a quad bike, a role he was hoping some friends would fill. But he had some trouble roping his friends in for the dangerous pursuit, and he was left to ask his neighbours to tow him on a four wheel drive. 'We were probably going for a kilometre then it got a bit boggy,' he said. Mr Lynch said he has been skurfing for over a decade, swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up. 'Baandee Lake is pretty close to here, you can't get to the surf very often in Merredin, so I started skurfing behind the boat,' he said. 'Skurfing' typically involves the surfboard rider being towed by a quad bike, but this time Mr Lynch used a neighbours four wheel drive .

Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested. Scientists at the University of Exeter have warned of the danger after analysing data collected from beaches across England and Wales in 2012. They focused on a strain of E.coli bacteria resistant to an important class of antibiotics called third-generation cephalosporins, or 3GCs. Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested . Study leader Dr William Gaze said: 'We know very little about how the natural environment can spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans, or how our exposure to these microbes can affect health. 'People are exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in many ways, through person-to-person contact, via food and as a result of international travel. 'Our research establishes recreational use of coastal waters as an additional route of exposure. 'With millions of people visiting beaches in England and Wales each year, there is a risk of people ingesting 3GC resistant E. coli and it looks like water-users' exposure to all resistant bacteria could be even higher.' If you enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up a strain of E.coli bacteria (pictured) resistant to an important class of antibiotics . Salt in sea water is known to kill off some bacteria, but not all. Although only 0.12 per cent of the E.coli found in coastal waters and rivers running on to beaches belonged to the strain, researchers said this was enough to present a 'potential risk'.

Matthews, pictured, is accused of sexually abusing a 3-year-old boy on a plane . Federal prosecutors in Utah have charged a man accused of sexually abusing a sleeping 3-year-old boy on a plane. Investigators say in court documents filed Tuesday that the child was seated next to Kevin C. Matthews on the flight from Chicago to San Diego with a layover in Salt Lake City. Charging documents say that the boy's mother was concerned about being seated across the aisle from her son Monday. However, their family was flying standby and Matthews appeared to be friendly, according to the documents. Prosecutors say other passengers saw Matthews touch the child inappropriately after the boy fell asleep and reported the groping to flight attendants, who moved the child to his mother's lap. The Deseret News reported that Matthews is 48 and from Illinois. He is facing an abusive sexual contact charge over the alleged incident on the Delta flight, according to the newspaper. In an affidavit obtained by the Deseret News, a FBI agent said Matthews said he'd drank several glasses of wine, but denied being drunk. Matthews also reportedly denied touching the child's groin with his hand. Matthews told the agent 'it was possible that he touched (the boy), but if he did touch (him), it was an accident,' according to the affidavit. Defense attorney Susanne Gustin did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

A sterilising at St Vincent's Private Hospital claimed another technician approached her and repeatedly sexually harassed her . Ms Nacu told the tribunal she initially believed her colleague, Isagani Alano, was talking about a pet snake. She alleged that Mr Alano then pointed to his penis and said: 'This one'. On another occasion he discussed his penis with her and offered to show it to her. She also said Mr Alano frequently slapped her on the back despite her requests that he stop. In a decision handed down on Tuesday, the tribunal rejected Ms Nacu's version of events, noting that if the harassment had occurred it would likely have come to the attention of her supervisors.

The designer of the Swirl tap claims the hollow vortex of water created by the faucet can save around 15 per cent more water than standard taps. He claims that it is also more comfortable to use as the water does not pour out in a solid jet. The Swirl tap sends water from the tap in a symmetrical design that apparently saves 15 per cent more water . Simin Qiu, a student at the London Royal College of Art, said he hoped the design might become popular in hotels and homes. He said: 'It's a very simple design. I've used two turbines to create the effect, with one making the water flow clockwise and the other anticlockwise. 'The spiral is an organic shape water takes in nature and I wanted to recreate that. 'It is more comfortable on people's hands because it's not flowing in a solid line. My design changes the angle the water hits your hands at and it's smoother.' Mr Qiu is curerntly testing a prototype of his tap, which took him two months to design. It uses turbines that spin in opposite directions inside the valve at the mouth of the tap to send thin streams of water spiralling down into the sink. The Swirl tap uses two turbines inside the faucet (left) to send the water into a spiral. The graphic on the right shows how the turbines fit together with push value to provide a spinning vortex of water onto the users hands . The tap works by pressing a single button on top, allowing water at a preset temperature to flow out of the tap . The tap is operated by touching a switch on the top. Mr Qiu says the desing allows water to come out at the same pressure as a standard faucet but uses less water. However, the temperature from the tap has to be preset so that the water coming out will always be the right temperature. Mr Qui added: 'I hope it will be ready by the end of the year. 'It will be more expensive than ordinary taps, it's not something that will be in every home. 'It's a luxury product that will probably be in hotels and limited use in homes by next year.' Designer Simin Qiu envisages his tap being used in hotels and luxury homes but it could find wider uses as the swirling pattern it produces in the flow can help to reduce the amount of water used when washing hands .", "completion": "response:\n\nSwirl tap was designed by art student Simin Qiu at the Royal College of Art .\nHe is currently testing a prototype tap and hopes it will go on sale next year .\nTwo spinning turbines in the tap head send the water into a hollow vortex .\nThis uses 15 per cent less water than traditional taps, the designer claims .\nThe hollow jet is also more gentle to use on the hands than traditional taps ."}

Jedinak had until 6pm on Tuesday night to appeal against the charge - a move which would have made him available to face Southampton - but he decided to accept it at the risk of a lengthier ban for a frivolous appeal. As the 30-year-old Australian has already been sent off this season - against Sunderland - he has been given a four-match ban, the FA confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. Mile Jedinak's elbow clearly makes contact with the face of Diafra Sakho after the ball had gone . As well as missing the trip to Southampton on Tuesday night, Jedinak is banned for Palace's home match against QPR on March 14, an away fixture at Stoke on March 21 and Manchester City's visit to Selhurst Park on April 6.

Take it one step further. Instead of bees hovering around a tree, imagine cheese balls. Solo cups in the place of birds, glow sticks as locusts. What seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in Thomas Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series. Jackson grew up in Rhode Island and worked in publishing in New York for 13 years, ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with Forbes magazine. But somewhere along the way, he picked up a camera. He found photography \"effortlessly fulfilling\" compared to the frequent challenges of writing. So he dove in, lens first. After a charming series featuring a robot, he struck a cadence in creating \"swarms\" with inanimate objects such as Post-it notes and plastic plates. \"I started creating these whimsical, fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us,\" Jackson explained. That's what initially catches the eye -- the uncanny. The bizarre gathering in the behavior of insects or birds, made up of something that shouldn't be there. At first, he relied on digital enhancements to polish his illusions. But as the series evolved, he relied less on editing and more on the installations themselves. More than half of Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series is digitally untouched. How Jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical. He only hints at the mechanics. It's just \"wires,\" he said, casually, not revealing enough evidence to ruin the magic. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"But if you look close enough, it will reveal all of its secrets.\" He spends about a day building the installations, and he usually shoots his photos at dusk. The photo of the pink Solo cups was shot against mountainous terrain in Wyoming. The cups, already at odds with nature, look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks. Jackson seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement, creating what an Internet commentator calls \"a frat party being sucked into a black hole.\" The idea of a swarm -- be it insects or \"thank you\" bags -- fascinates Jackson. They are disconcerting and familiar at once, creating a conundrum that warrants a closer look. \"Maybe because they fly in the face of how we see the world,\" he said.

In the region, most polar bears build their dens around November and come out of hibernation in February. The photographer said that most bears in the park, hungry after months of being in their dens, are anxious to get hunting seals before the spring thaw. Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier. He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold. 'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side. 'They are programmed to survive like no other animal on earth, and the sheer enormity of the tasks these mothers have to take on every couple of years is beyond belief.

People spend more time on Google searching for Queen singer Freddy Mercury than planet Mercury ... and Freddie's been gone for nearly a quarter-century. Not even NASA spends much time there, making it the least-explored inner planet in the solar system. But one question has long perplexed scientists: Why's the darned thing so dark? Compared with our own moon, which is about the same size, Mercury reflects much less light. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Brown University and the Planetary Sciences Institute say they may have found the answer: It's been \"effectively painted black,\" in the words of Megan Bruck Syal, a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore. Over the eons, the researchers argue in a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon-rich comets may have contributed enough dark-hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light. The pieces seem to fit together: There's a lot more carbon dust thrown off from comets close to the sun, where Mercury orbits -- about 50 times as much for Mercury as for our moon, the researchers say. And tests using a big NASA gun made to simulate planetary impacts on a small scale seem to show the theory is plausible, the authors say. \"We show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent,\" said Peter Schultz, a professor emeritus of geological sciences at Brown University. \"From the standpoint of spectral analysis, it's like an invisible paint.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nMercury was \"painted black\" by millions of years of micrometeorites, researchers say .\nThe research could solve the puzzle of why the planet appears so dark ."}

Brown missed the defeat by Ireland after experiencing headaches while attempting to complete strict return-to-play protocols. Mike Brown is ready to return to England's starting XV after missing the Ireland defeat two weeks ago . Brown was knocked unconscious just 12 minutes into the win over Italy and was ruled out for two weeks . The England full back was treated on the pitch but could not continue as Stuart Lancaster's side won 47-17 . After agonising about owning up to his symptoms, knowing it would see him miss the trip to Dublin, he reluctantly alerted team doctors about his concussion. ‘Pulling out is one of the worst things I’ve ever had to go through in my whole life,’ Brown said. ‘As a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country’s jersey and representing everyone in the country. ‘I went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning — I usually get up about 7.30 to 8 — and during that time I was sat in my room thinking should I try the next stage, should I carry on?

The number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades. Conservationists have created a ‘hedgehog improvement area’ which opens today in Solihull, the West Midlands. Scroll down for video . Britain's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area is launched today in attempt to slow the species’ dramatic decline (file picture) The Warwickshire Wildlife Trust project includes a 220-acre haven for the prickly mammals. A group of volunteers will manage the green space, helping to establish a central sanctuary from which it is hoped the hedgehog population will be able to disperse and inhabit the surrounding countryside. But Simon Thompson, hedgehog officer for Warwickshire Wildlife Trust, said people across the country can do far more to help by taking simple measures in their own back gardens. Part of the reason that hedgehogs have decline so far is thought to be linked to the widespread loss of bushes and hedges, which have been replaced in many back gardens by hard wooden or metal fences. Hard barriers make it impossible for hedgehogs to move from place to place - if they are isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery, they cannot feed or mate. Mr Thompson said: ‘Something as basic as linking up a series of small isolated green patches with a hole no bigger than the size of a CD is a remarkably powerful and positive action for hedgehog conservation. The number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades (file picture) ‘Making these connections between our own fenced-in islands of green spaces creates a continuous habitat corridor through which hedgehogs can forage, seek shelter and even rendezvous with potential mates.’ Fay Vass, chief executive of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, which is backing the project, said: ‘We are delighted to be funding such an exciting and important project in Warwickshire that will hopefully benefit many hedgehogs. ‘Simple measures such as ensuring there is a five inch square gap in boundary walls and fences make a massive difference to local hedgehog populations. ‘There are many ways people can assist this declining species and we hope this project will complement our work to highlight the plight of the hedgehog.’", "completion": "response:\n\nBritain's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area launches today .\nHopes reserve will help slow the species' dramatic decline in last 20 years .\nWarwickshire Wildlife Trust project includes 220-acre haven for hedgehogs .\nPrickly mammals' decline said to be linked to loss of bushes and hedges ."}

The beasts find them a miserable and stressful experience, research reveals. As a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours, according to a study by Nottingham Trent University. Stable condition: Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated . Scientists found animals that were isolated had higher levels of stress hormones and became difficult to manage. The findings, published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour, showed that horses are at their happiest in a paddock. Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated. These stress levels could also lead to sickness and disease, the study published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour found. Research: The study by Nottingham Trent University (above) found that as a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours . Equine welfare expert Kelly Yarnell told the Daily Telegraph: ‘To the human eye, the stable appears safe and inviting and is based on the belief of what the horse finds comfortable. ‘However, for a social animal that spends most of its time in close contact with other horses, the isolation brought about by single housing could activate an equine stress response.’ She said equine welfare would be improved by shared housing. In the wild, horses live in herds that move over up to 30 sq miles while domestic horses often spend most of the day inside. Lee Hackett, director of equine policy at The British Horse Society, said the study should change the way we keep horses. He said: ‘It is fairly obvious that keeping any animal in a domestic setting could potentially compromise it, whether that be a hamster in a cage or a lion in a zoo.'", "completion": "response:\n\nStables prevent horses interacting with their neighbours, scientists say .\nIsolated animals suffer higher stress levels and become harder to manage .\nNottingham Trent University study shows horses are happiest in paddock ."}

The college’s board of trustees approved the new policy on Wednesday night. Under the new guidelines, Wellesley College says it will consider for admission any applicant who 'lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman.'

The updated code will come into effect in time for the next admission cycle for the Class of 2020. The move follows similar policy changes at all-women's colleges such as Mills College in California, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and Mount Holyoke and Simmons College, both in Massachusetts.

Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation.

While she warned the duo it could be 'dangerous', investigators claim the tutor took no strict action to stop the operation. In January, a report from the Logan County Sheriff says the student brought some of the liquor to show in science class. Thompson disposed of it instead of alerting the principle.

But people across the globe are making that vow despite the deadly attack in the Tunis on Wednesday. Twenty-three people, most of them tourists, were killed after gunmen opened fire inside the Bardo Museum, a stone's throw from the parliament building. The \"I will come to Tunisia\" social media campaign is aimed at protecting the North African nation's tourism industry -- which is critical to the country's economy. The social media campaign features users holding up signs saying they will travel to the North African country. \"I will travel to Tunisia this summer,\" reads a sign held up by a girl from China. A Dutch man's paper says: \"Heroes! I will visit Tunisia and celebrate your Independence Day.\" Tens of thousands of people online have expressed support and solidarity with #JeSuisBardo (\"I am Bardo\"), #JeSuisTunisien (\"I am Tunisian\"), and #PrayForTunisia trending on Twitter. Some one in five Tunisians rely on tourism for their living, the nation's tourism minister said in 2013. Travel warnings in place in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries could cripple Tunisia's economy. It's a fresh wound after a painful few years in the birthplace of the Arab Spring. Visits to the country dropped significantly after the unrest of the 2010-2011 Jasmine Revolution, but the numbers had been bouncing back before the museum attack. An online advertisement to visit Tunisia, posted long before the attacks, shows people holding hands at some of Tunisia's most treasured landmarks. Human chains form across beaches, mountains, ancient ruins, the desert. The message: \"All united to welcome you.\" This week, those words were repeated in social media. A Tunisian woman, also part of the campaign, holds a sign: \"Welcome To Tunisia. We are not terrorists,\" followed by the hashtag #notafraid. In this online campaign, fear itself is the enemy. A Tunisian lawmaker spoke to that this week, sharing with the world: . \"We are not afraid.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nCampaign to support Tunisian tourism takes hold on social media .\nTourism official: One in five Tunisians depends on tourists to make a living .\n#JeSuisBardo and #PrayForTunisia are trending ."}

Evan Kohlmann of Flashpoint Intelligence, told NBC: 'There are no indications that the individuals behind these latest hacks have any real connection to ISIS, and these defacements have taken place amid a spate of recent attacks where ordinary hackers have cynically used far-fetched references to ISIS as a means of attracting media attention.' Southwest Montana Community Federal Credit Union's site has remained down, with the message 'Under Construction.' Chief executive, Tom Dedman, said the site was offline so a security specialist could investigate. The hacks over the weekend appeared on websites with little or no link to one another, fueling speculation the terrorist organisation was not responsible.

'The more I see him, the more I think he's got fantastic potential. I've always known it having seen him come through the age-group teams,' Lancaster said. 'We have a lot of competition at fly-half, but he's also adept in the centres. That's one of the options I'd like to look at for him in the future. For definite he'll be a part of our World Cup camp. 'In your World Cup squad of 31, you absolutely have to have players who can play in different positions like Henry. You need that flexibility, it's crucial.

As females fight for equality on all terms, stars like Emma Watson have encountered awkward situations at the end of a meal when they insist on paying their way. But others, like Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton say that a man SHOULD look after a woman - in her new blog for Babycentre, the singer explains why Emma's stance on male chivalry is wrong. Natasha Hamilton with her boyfriend Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive . Natasha, who is currently dating Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive, said: 'What is wrong with a man displaying good old fashioned ‘chivalry’ and feeling uncomfortable that she wants to pay? 'This is not a weakness on either side, it’s about letting a man be a considerate, generous, kind human being. Why emasculate him? It’s unnecessary. 'This just puts more pressure on women.' Natasha goes on to point out that the pay gap between women and women is still huge in most of the western world, so through no fault of their own,females bring home much less money than their male counterparts. She said: 'I recently took part in the TV show The Big Reunion, which was a great success. 'But the following year all the female acts got dropped from the tour and all the male acts had yet another opportunity to bring home the bacon.' Actress Emma Watson recently revealed that she tried to pay for the bill at the end of a date and it made the man feel very awkward . Natasha continued: 'There are so many expectations placed on women now. 'If shows like Ex-On-the-Beach are anything to go by, its common place for lads to think they can “bang” as many “birds” as they want, like we’re pieces of meat. 'This is the cultural shift that is openly part of the youth today. 'On top of this, now it’s being suggested girls “pick up their own tab”. Well, it just gets rosier for men doesn’t it?' Natasha Hamilton (left) with her Atomic Kitten band mates Jenny Frost (centre) and Liz McClarnon (right) in 2003 . In fact, Natasha believes that in the 21st Century, it is crucial that men be taught to look after the fairer sex. She said: 'I personally think that men should look after women. That is not a weakness. 'By allowing them to do that, it may create more empathy and stop some men viewing women as “bangable” pieces of meat. 'I fully expect my three boys to be respectful, kind and generous to their future partners too.'", "completion": "response:\n\nEmma Watson tried to pay for meal on date and it made the mood awkward .\nNatasha Hamilton criticises the actress for 'emasculating' the man .\nShe believes men looking after women should not be seen as a weakness ."}

And there is no more unforgiving environment than the high-stakes world of Formula One. \"Racing is one of those... probably a crueler sport in that there's so many other variables,\" says Red Bull's No.1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, ahead of Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix. \"Unfortunately it's not like tennis where all the racquets are pretty much the same and you can't blame anyone but yourself.\" Ricciardo experienced the full extent of F1's cruelty at last year's Melbourne race. The Australian crossed the line in second place -- seemingly becoming the first Aussie to finish on the podium at Albert Park -- but jubilation soon turned to despair. He was disqualified hours after the race when officials ruled his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate, a rule which states each car is limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per race and was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient. \"It's frustrating, I mean it's a part of the sport which will always be frustrating,\" said the 25-year-old, reflecting on what was his Red Bull debut. \"I'm sure even Lewis (Hamilton) and Nico (Rosberg) last year were frustrated at the times because you never have the perfect car,\" he added, referring to the two Mercedes drivers, who finished first and second last season. \"But it is what it is, I signed up for that a long time ago, and you just learn to accept it.\" It's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion Hamilton was forced to retire from last year's race at Albert Park. But technical blunders don't always end in disaster -- Hamilton won the Italian Grand Prix after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race, and Finnish driver Valterri Bottas lost a wheel in 2014's opener before roaring to a fifth-place finish. Despite Ricciardo's previous disappointment, he's can't wait to race on his home turf again next Sunday. \"I definitely feel privileged to have a home race... it just increases all the hype and all the excitement\" said Ricciardo, adding that he would use \"all the Australian flags and all the cheers to my advantage.\" After last year's disaster Ricciardo is looking to make things right, \"There's a little bit of redemption, I'm confident we can get it back.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nRed Bull's No.1 driver Daniel Ricciardo says Formula One is a \"crueler sport\"\nLast year Ricciardo was disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix after finishing second .\nThe 25-year-old is looking for redemption in Melbourne on Sunday ."}

The actor posed on a bearskin rug to show off how he looks as masked Marvel character Deadpool in a post that quickly got positive responses from fans on social media.

The move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries, including India, backed it. Speaking against the proposal, US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said: “We must speak plainly about what Russia tried to do today… diminish the authority of the UN secretary general and export to the UN its domestic hostility to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) rights.” The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. (File picture) India went with the Russian proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations. The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. But last year, secretary general Ban Ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws. The Russian envoy at the UN had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body. This is also perhaps the reason for India to back the Russian proposal. While Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the other countries on India’s side, 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all. India’s own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the Supreme Court last year. There is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the Supreme Court. After their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on January 28, 2014, the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on April 3, 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court. The apex court said the government’s indecision and flip-flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation. The Bench, which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of Parliament, questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a Law Commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands. The court said this proved that the Centre wanted the section to remain in the statute.", "completion": "response:\n\nIndia voted to support a proposal by Russia, to deny gay couples working for the UN staff benefits .\nThe move was defeated by 80 votes to 43 ."}

This is the seventh fatal shooting in the area since Michael Brown was gunned down by Ferguson cop Darren Wilson sparking national unrest, reports The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police say the shooting happened when an officer pulled a car over at the corner of Morton and Page avenues at 10:15 a.m. Thomas Allen Jr. 34, was shot while driving this car as a police officer 'in fear for his life' was taken along for a ride after a routine stop . While the driver was being questioned, another passenger - Thomas Allen Jr. of St. Louis - is reported to have climbed into the driver's seat and tried to drive off. The officer got into the car and tried fighting with Allen and, 'in fear for his life,' shot the man three times. Fox 2 Now reports one of those shots struck Allen in the neck. The car then jumped a curb coming to a stop behind a home. Allen was transported to a hospital in critical condition - he later died. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is investigating the shooting . The officer was also taken to the hospital for treatment. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is now investigating the incident. The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead. Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community. A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report to emphasize an overarching attitude that had a 'disparate impact' on black people, it is claimed. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, officer are under fire for shooting a homeless man dead on the sidewalk in broad daylight. In a video posted online, four officers are seen standing over the victim, who was sat among sleeping bags and tents in Skid Row, downtown LA.

The very public display of human-like affection was photographed by Jacques Matthysen at the Kariega Game Reserve, east of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It occurred while a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor at the popular tourist destination. Photographer Jacques Matthysen said two young elephants locked trunks, like humans would hold hands, in a touching embrace . Jacques, who works as a photographer for the reserve, said he is used to seeing the young elephants act in a playful manner, but their affectionate behaviour took him by surprise. As Jacques and a group of visitors looked on, two of the elephants stopped chasing each other and entwined their trunks in a loving gesture. At one point it appeared as if they were ‘kissing’. The 37-year-old photographer said: ‘The mood in the herd seemed “excited”. We moved out to a safer distance - about 50 metres (164ft) - away when one of the younger bulls, about eight years of age, started chasing a younger bull. The heart-warming moment occurred as a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor . ‘What we first thought to be aggression, turned out to be all playfulness. ‘Soon a number of younger bulls and cows started to play around.

He said two of the elephants locked trunks like humans would hold hands. ‘I quickly focused my camera on them, to capture the “loving” moment. ‘I am very happy with the sighting and images.

However, for the 37-year-old owner of Surf Simply, a surfing resort in Nosara, the sport was an early love that blossomed later in life. He first paddled out to the big blue when he was a teenager, but his professional life took a different turn when he embarked on a fine art degree in London. In the end, the pull of the waves was too strong and Hill decamped to Costa Rica with a goal to create a surfing school with a difference. \"I wanted to create a really intimate space that was a long way away from the putting the lots of people in the water kind of business model that surf schools often are. I wanted to just have a few people, 12 people each week, and then this area is somewhere where they can completely decompress and just focus on being coached how to surf better,\" he says. A large chunk of the school's training is devoted to theory classes, and Hill also films his students while they're surfing so that he can show them what aspects of their technique they need to improve: \"The first time you see yourself surfing, it's kind of mortifying. It's a little bit like hearing yourself sing for the first time. But, like most sports, it's the best coaching tool we have,\" he says. Hill's fine art credentials have not gone to waste though, as his creative training helped him design the website as well as the resort logo. While following his passion for surfing was important, Hill stresses that figuring out how to make money out of it was equally significant. \"The business side of it has to work, the numbers have to make sense. Otherwise, what you've got is a brilliant hobby that's not a business,\" he says. Hill says that, while he feels fortunate that his work fulfills him, it still involves ordinary tasks that can sometimes be mundane. \"I don't think anyone is going to find a job that they love all the time, but if you can find something that you love most of the time, you're luckier than most people in the world.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nRu Hill trained in fine art in London .\nHowever, his heart was in surfing and he opened a surf retreat in Costa Rica .\nHe says following a passion is important, but it has to make financial sense ."}

Ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self-titled album in December 2013, it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing. The latest artist to do so is rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release March 23. Instead, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" was made available on iTunes and Spotify early Monday. Lamar, who has been hailed as the savior of hip-hop, got a major shout-out from fellow artist Taylor Swift. Among the other artists who've surprised fans: . Drake . The rapper thrilled fans in February when he snuck out \"If You're Reading This, It's Too Late.\" Like Beyonce, he clued fans in via an Instagram post. The 17-track project was billed as a mixtape. The rapper also released a short film titled \"Jungle.\" U2 . The shock in the band's album \"Songs of Innocence\" was not only that it was released but that iTunes subscribers had no choice but to get it. Apple made the album part of an automatic download in October as part of the iPhone 6 announcement. U2 frontman Bono later apologized, and Apple distributed info to customers on how they could delete the album after some complained that the automatic download was invasive. David Bowie . In 2013, the legendary rocker unexpectedly released \"The Next Day.\" It was his first new project in a decade, and fans were thrilled, as the famously private Bowie had been off the grid for a while. Wolfmother . The Australian trio received much less attention than some others when they dropped \"New Crown\" in March 2014 with no promotion or marketing. Kid Cudi . The rapper's \"Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon\" arrived online in March 2014 and led Billboard to ask, \"Is the Beyonce approach working for other 'surprise' albums?\" \"I wonder when this is done frequently, does the surprise factor wane?\" one executive told Billboard. \"If there are a lot of releases promoted this way, it will become less impactful.

There are 2,611 tons of World War II-era mustard agent at the Pueblo depot. Here are nine things to know about these chemical weapons and how we got here: . 1. First use: April 22 marks the 100th anniversary of the first use of chemical weapons in modern warfare at Ypres in Belgium. 2. Huge production: From World War I to 1968, the United States produced nearly 40,000 tons of chemical weapons. These weapons were either nerve agents or blister agents. 3. Scary stuff:  Mustard agent is a blister agent, which can cause skin redness and itching, eye irritation, scarring, and an increased risk for lung and respiratory cancer. 4. Into the sea: From 1967 to 1970, the U.S. Army disposed of thousands of chemical warfare agents and ammunition into the sea as part of Operation Cut Holes and Sink 'Em (CHASE). 5. No more: Congress passed a law in 1972 known as the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act prohibiting this kind of dumping. 6. Date of destruction: In 1997, the United States ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty and agreed to destroy all of its chemical weapons by April 29, 2012. 7. Work not done: 90% of the U.S. stockpile -- 30,500 tons -- was destroyed by the treaty date in 2012 at depots in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, Oregon, Utah and Johnson Atoll in the Pacific. The remaining 10% --  close to 3,100 tons -- is at two sites in Colorado and Kentucky. 9. Don't burn it: Residents in Colorado and Kentucky protested the use of incineration to get rid of the chemical weapons stockpile. The process of neutralization was adopted. 8. Pueblo's stockpile: The Pueblo Chemical Depot has about 780,000 shells containing mustard agent. 9. The last one: The Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond, Kentucky, will have the remaining chemical agent stockpile, which is a fifth of the size of the one at Pueblo Chemical Depot.

Peters stopped, ran past a woman making futile attempts to pat out the fire and tackled the burning man into an icy snowbank, using handfuls of dirty snow to douse the flames. Peters and two other motorists were credited with saving the life of 84-year-old Christopher Flowers after his clothing caught fire from a cigarette he was smoking while driving on Monday morning. Police and fire officials in the town of Gates said Tuesday that Flowers, of Chili, was driving when the multiple shirts he was wearing caught fire from a dropped lit cigarette. Flowers pulled over and got out of his car as flames spread across his clothing. Officials say three passing motorists — Peters and two women — pulled over to help. Peters said one of the women was trying to knock down the flames with her hands, but wasn't having any success. 'I scooped the guy up and did an end-zone dive into the snowbank,' Peters told The Associated Press. Peters said Flowers was wearing several layers of clothing, including two or three flannel shirts and a couple T-Shirts topped by a hooded sweatshirt. The three rescuers removed the smoldering clothing and wrapped him in a blanket that one of the women had in her trunk. Flowers was hospitalized and listed in guarded condition Tuesday with severe burns to his upper body. Peters believed Flowers pulled over and got out of his car to fish the burning cigarette from his multi-layered clothing, only to have Monday's windy conditions fan the flames to the point they engulfed his entire torso. 'I've just never seen anything like it,' said Peters, a 52-year-old former Army helicopter mechanic from Gates. 'It was like newspapers catching on fire.'

Firemen refused to risk their safety by rescuing a cat that had been stuck in a tree for six days – so two young men stepped in to save the day. The pair climbed about 50ft to bring down Spot from a leylandii in Stroud, Gloucestershire, after firefighters said the branches were too thin to support their weight. Several attempts were made to lure her down and the fire service visited the scene twice, after the RSPCA was called. Gloucestershire’s deputy chief fire officer, Andy Hermiston, said: 'This is the second time we were called out because a cat was stuck 50ft up a tree. The first time, a month ago, the cat managed to get down itself. 'On both occasions, we quickly discovered that the branches at the top of the tree where the cat was stuck were too thin to support the weight of a firefighter. 'While rescuing animals is an important part of our work, it cannot be at the risk of our firefighter's safety. 'Although the service cannot condone members of the public putting themselves at risk we're pleased the cat has been safely returned to its owner and that the young people involved were not injured whilst carrying out the rescue.

Never one to miss a media opportunity, Trump, the owner of the Blue Monster course in Florida, got a scuba diver to retrieve the 3-iron club which world No. 1 McIlroy had thought he had seen the last of during Friday's second round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. The 68-year-old American entrepreneur presented it to McIlroy before his final round Sunday, telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf's rules. \"He's never one to miss an opportunity,\" McIlroy told the official PGA Tour website after his round. \"It was fine. It was good fun.\" Not that opportunity knocked for McIlroy when he chose the 3-iron to play his third shot to the 18th and final hole of the tournament and promptly found the water again. The Northern Irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics, before placing it back in the bag. His mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one-under-par, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson. McIlroy had promised to return the club to Trump after the round and was as good as his word. \"We're thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for Doral, putting it on a beautiful mount,\" Trump said. Johnson is looking set to be one of McIlroy's main rivals in the first major of the season, the U.S. Masters at Augusta, next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the PGA Tour. The 30-year-old American took a six-month break from the Tour last July to cope with \"personal problems\" and returned earlier this year. Johnson finished with a three-under 69 in testing conditions to leave him one ahead of long-time leader JB Holmes and two clear of Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion.

The 17-year-olds face aggravated animal cruelty and armed trespassing charges after tying the hound, now named Cabela, to railroad tracks and shooting her multiple times. Surveillance video from the area showed a group of individuals walking the dog along the tracks in the city's Sulphur Springs neighborhood before later running away, said Detective Patrick Messmer. Neighbors heard gunshots and police were called. Cabela was purchased to be used in dog fighting, but she wasn't any good at it so they wanted to get rid of her, according to Messmer. \"This appears to be an isolated incident,\" he said.  \"It doesn't appear that there was a large amount of dog fighting that goes on in the neighborhood.\" On March 5, police found Cabela tightly tied to the tracks and shot three times -- twice in the neck and once in the shoulder. \"Nothing gets you ready ... to see a dog -- a helpless animal -- tied so tight to a railroad track around the neck that it's literally pinned down,\" said Sgt. Rich Mills, who freed her. \"She was literally pinned down. She could not get away even if she tried.\" Once freed, Mills rushed Cabela to Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center. Initially, it was thought the young dog would have to her right front leg amputated because the damage was so severe, but a metal rod was inserted and she's recovering. In fact, Cabela's already walking on her repaired leg. Rehabilitation will take four to six weeks, according to Dr. Jamie Davidson.

Donations have ranged from $20 to several hundred dollars and came from as far away as Germany and England. The teens in the case were identified by police from the surveillance video. One of them has a lengthy record and was already known to authorities.

Carver was on Merseyside to witness the Toffees come from behind to win 2-1 against Dynamo Kiev in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday night. But he was taken aback by the level of unrest on the terraces after they fell behind early on. John Carver sympathised with his opposite number Roberto Martinez, but insists Everton are under pressure . Carver's Newcastle side are relatively safe in 11th place, but Everton are still too close to the relegation zone . Martinez has come under fire from fans as he tries to balance Premier League survival with European football . ‘I've got to be honest, it was pretty daunting. I was there with Steve Stone and Dave Watson, an Everton legend, and he'd never seen that before - he found it quite strange,’ said Carver. ‘So I’ve said to my players that all the pressure is going to be on Everton at Goodison Park. ‘They coped with it well in the end and got a good goal and dominated the second half. They deserved credit for coming back to win. ‘But there’s no pressure on us, the players can go and express themselves.’ Everton are 16th in the Premier League after a campaign disrupted by their participation in Europe. Carver was shocked by the levels of unrest when Oleg Gusev put Dynamo Kiev ahead on Thursday night . Newcastle travel to Everton on Sunday looking for only their second win in the last six league games . And Carver has sympathy with Martinez given his own experience of a relegation battle in 2013 as Newcastle juggled the demands of a Europa League schedule. ‘It’s difficult to balance the demands of the Europa League and we can vouch for that when you’ve got a squad like we had then and they have now, it’s very difficult,’ he said. ‘They’ve played 14 games more than us. Only the sides with huge squads will cope.

Dr Lindsey Doe, a blogger under the name 'Doe Eyes' who specializes in sexual harassment, dedicated her latest clip to the teenager who has approached her daughter at school, on the bus, and with poems - despite multiple rejections. In a post titled Dear Boy Who Likes My Daughter, that has amassed more than 250,000 views, Doe explains that pursuing somebody without consent is harassment. Instead, she advises, he should write about his feelings in a diary. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Leave her alone': Dr Lindsey Doe directed a message to the boy who keeps asking out her daughter . Doe, who used to work for the University of Montana, says: 'I don’t like how you treat [my daughter.] Are you confused? You probably picked up messages from society about how when you want something, you have to \"try harder, go at it, do whatever you can to get it. Don’t give up!\" 'Maybe it’s for this reason that you repeatedly ask my daughter out. In the halls, on the bus, and you write her poems.' For his own understanding, she explains the appropriate way to act after asking a girl out. If she says 'I don't know', give her space. 'Maybe' prompts a conversation about her feelings of uncertainty. Only in the instance that she says 'ask me again later' should he ask again - but much later. Doe, who blogs on YouTube as 'Doe Eyes', explains that he is harassing her daughter with his requests . If he wants to express his feelings, she explains, he should write a diary or speak to a trusted friend . But her daughter, she says, has simply responded: 'no thanks', 'stop asking me', and 'no, no go away'. 'Person Who Likes My Daughter, this goes for all aspects of your life,' Doe says. 'If someone tells you \"no\" in any way and you ask again, it's not cool, it's not attractive, it's not respectful, it's harassment. 'My daughter has the right to change her mind and the ability to let you know if she does. 'Until then I expect that you do not ask her out, do not suggest a relationship, do not talk to her about her discomfort with you pursuing her.

But for one karate-kicking great-grandmother in Kansas, there is no letting up. Helen Dugan, a third-degree black belt, continues to lead karate classes at the school she set up, Champs Achievers, despite passing the milestone. Battling on: Despite turning 80, Helen Dugan, owner of karate school Champs Achievers, is not letting up . Aiming high: After earning her black belt at 61, Dugan was inspired to teach others the sport in Kansas . Iron fist: Dugan set up the class for disabled children and said it was important to 'build on their strengths' The great-grandmother of 17 only took up the sport when she took two of her children to a class at the age of 47, the Kansas City Star reports. She said: 'We never had karate when I was a child, so I took my sons to a class and I realised that my two skinny sons didn't need the exercise and so I got into the back row of the class.' Her children lasted four years before as she puts it, 'they discovered girls and got married', but she 'was hooked'. Dugan, who has been married to husband Barney for 57 years, took karate classes for 14 years, earning her black belt at the age of 61. At the time she was also working as a nurse in the Center School District in Kansas City, in Missouri. Leading the way: Dugan takes a hit from seven-year-old Brayden Bond during a class in Lenexa, Kansas . Listen in: The great-grandmother quiets the class as three-year-old Aiden Degnan tries to get her attention . Friendly face: Dugan has seen her class grow in the last 20 years and it now caters for more than 50 children . Jousting: Dugan takes on five-year-old Micah Jenkins using pugil sticks during one of her sessions . Inspired to pass on her expertise to others, the mother-of-five set up a non-profit karate class called Champs aimed at helping those with a disability. Karate and other martial arts taught at the group -  including judo, jujitsu, tai chi and a defensive street-fighting discipline called Guided Chaos - can improve concentration, stamina, balance, motor skills, independence and self-esteem. She said: 'I started the group because the class I was learning in had children who couldn't keep up, so I took them aside. Sometimes it was because of learning disabilities, or it was children with ADHD. 'I then started teaching them separately.' Now almost 20 years later, the group is going from strength to strength and caters for more than 50 children in the area.", "completion": "response:\n\nHelen Dugan continues to lead karate classes despite passing age of 80 .\nThe great-grandmother of 17 only took up the sport when she was 47 .\nAfter earning black belt at 61, set up a karate class for disabled children ."}

A mother threatened to cut the throat of a 10-year-old girl who had an argument with her daughter, a court heard. Hannah Kingsley screamed, 'Don't shout at my child' and swore at the girl while holding a knife following an ongoing neighbourhood dispute. The 45-year-old avoided jail over the incident, but was given a 12-month community order at Teesside Crown Court. Prosecutor Shaun Dodds said Kingsley, from Middlesbrough, intervened after the little girl had an argument with her daughter. 'She appears with a knife, shouting at the child,' he said. 'While holding the knife she shouts, \"Don’t ever shout at my child, if you do I will cut your throat,\" and various expletives.' The court heard both sets of parents then became involved, leading to a fight in which Kingsley's partner Cornell Brown brandished a cosh. He was given a suspended jail sentence in a separate set of proceedings. Kingsley pleaded guilty to having a blade in a public place. The court heard she had previous convictions for dishonesty and drugs offending, but no history of violence. Scott Taylor, defending, told the court Kingsley had moved since the incident in July last year and she had no further contact with the family. Recorder Andrew Dallas said: 'There is obviously a background here and she appears to acknowledge the stupidity of what she did. 'Brandishing a knife in a public place in these circumstances was a foolish thing to do. 'It it had gone any further you would have been going to prison today. 'I take into account it was never your intention to cause any harm, though undoubtedly the child of your neighbour would have been frightened by the way you were behaving and the things you said were wholly inappropriate.'

Scientists believe the gene tells fat to gather around the middle, rather than the bottom and thighs. In other words, it influences whether someone is an ‘apple’, with a big tummy, or a ‘pear’, who widens out below the waist. It raises the possibility of pills that stop fat from being stored around the waist – meaning an end to pot bellies and muffin tops. Apple-shaped: Scientists have discovered that a gene called Plexin D1 influences whether a person is an 'apple', with a big belly, or a 'pear' with fat on their hips and thighs . And the benefits wouldn’t just be cosmetic. The discovery of the ‘apple-shape’ gene is important because being an ‘apple’ who stores fat around the middle is worse for health than being a ‘pear’. Unlike the fat that pads out pear-shapes, belly fat wraps around the body’s vital organs and produces hormones and other chemicals that tamper with blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar levels. As a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes. To get to the bottom of how fat is stored, the US researchers studied zebra fish, tiny tropical fish whose transparent bodies make it see their inner workings. By using a dye that turned fat cells fluorescent, they showed that fish without a gene called Plexin D1 stored less fat around their abdomen than usual. Muffin top: Fat around the middle is dangerous to health as it wraps itself around vital organs, and raises the risk of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes . Instead, the fat was stored in more a pear-shaped pattern, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. The fish without apple-shape gene were also better at processing sugar – something that should cut the odds of diabetes. With the Plexin-1 gene thought to have a similar role in people, the research paves the way for a drug that stops people from growing big bellies. Researcher Dr James Minchin, of Duke University, in North Carolina, said that this could also be good for health.", "completion": "response:\n\nPlexin D1 gene influences whether a person is 'apple' or 'pear' shaped .\nDiscovery raises possibility of pills to stop fat being stored on the belly .\nUnlike fat  on hips and thighs, belly fat wraps itself around vital organs .\nRaises risk of illnesses including heart disease, diabetes and stroke ."}

The White House is refusing to take him at his word. \"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,\" President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday. These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election. Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory. White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to say whether Netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would \"reassess\" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Administration officials have said the United States is now considering signing on to a U.N. resolution which supports a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls \"in droves\" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of \"rhetoric\" was \"contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly.\" Obama added: \"If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country.\" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month.

A male science teacher has been suspended after allegations that he had a threesome with two of his high school students in his classroom. Court documents have claimed that Ryen William Wilson also attempted to seduce two other pupils at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, via text message. Wilson is accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others. The 30-year-old is now facing two counts of child seduction. It has been claimed that 'Student One' told her friend 'Student Two' that she had been sleeping with Wilson in the academic year of 2013/14. The pair then claim they had a threesome with him, and 'Student One' later told police she had slept with Wilson a total of five times. It is understood the threesome happened only once. On March 13, police then spoke with a third student who said she was good friends with 'Student One' and let her her phone to text with Wilson until she got her own mobile phone. But 'Student Three' then said that Wilson continued to text her separately with comments such as “You know you want this\". She also told told police that she was then receiving so many texts from Wilson that she eventually had to change her phone number. According to court documents, the boyfriend of 'Student Three' later spotted the messages, got jealous and confronted Wilson via text. Police then spoke with a fourth student who told police she had also received texts from Wilson where he was regularly complimenting her looks. She said the flattery started after she sent him a question about homework on social media, and he responded saying she should text him on his private number with any further questions.

The Japanese artefacts – a wooden plaque and replica school textbook – went missing from the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre last Saturday as it hosted a Japan Day celebration. The replicas were loaned to the university from a museum in Japan, marking the first time they had ever been taken out of the country. Punt boats carry tourists on the river Cam past King's College at Cambridge University . Staff launched a search after they noticed the precious objects were missing. They eventually found the tourist who had mistaken the artefacts for souvenirs and returned them with an apology. University officials said the textbook is a replica of those used in Japanese schools during World War II. During the war residents of the island of Okinawa – a key battleground for Japanese and American forces – were forced to speak the Japanese language the rest of the country used, rather than their own dialect, for the purposes of unification. The Japanese artefacts were taken by a tourist during a Japan Day celebration at Cambridge University . As punishment, those who spoke their native tongue were forced to wear the wooden plaque around their neck. The artefacts are now being returned to the Peace Memorial Museum in Okinawa. Peter Roberts-Taira, the education centre's director, said he was relieved when he found out that the artefacts had been recovered. He said: ‘It's the first time these items have ever been out of Japan, so the museums themselves were taking a risk. University officials said they located the tourist and the artefacts were returned with an apology (file photo) ‘It was Saturday, right at the very end of the day when everyone was packing away that we realised they had gone. ‘One was a wooden plaque with some Japanese on it, the other was a maths book which children had in their classrooms.’ He added: ‘You wouldn't know they were valuable to look at, so maybe somebody just though they could take them. ‘The message went out wider to people who asked their friends, and apparently they discovered a friend of a friend had thought those things were possible to take away as souvenirs. ‘They are irreplaceable, if they are gone, they are gone forever.

It will be offered at in London through the NHS and privately. The non-invasive IONA test examines DNA in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders . Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad for processing. It is one of several non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) examinations that promise greater accuracy for women at high risk of having a Down’s baby. Eventually such NIPT tests will be routinely used to reassure all pregnant women. Current screening for Down’s on the NHS consists of the less-accurate ‘combined’ test, which uses ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby’s neck at 11 weeks, as well as a blood test. Professor Basky Thilaganathan, consultant obstetrician at St George’s, said the new test was the first to be regulated under the EU’s health and safety standards. He said: ‘Too many pregnant women have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results [women wrongly identified as being at risk] from the combined test – the IONA test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly.’ Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad . A study by the UK National Screening Committee to check whether NIPT should be offered routinely on the NHS is underway, involving five hospitals, and is due to report later this year. Trials of another NIPT test offering expectant mothers 99 per cent accuracy in screening for Down’s syndrome are being run by Great Ormond Street Hospital. NIPT has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the combined test. This means fewer women will undergo unnecessary invasive follow-up procedures which are stressful and carry a small risk of miscarriage. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha – the makers of the IONA test, said: ‘We recognised the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test.’", "completion": "response:\n\nNon-invasive IONA test examines foetus DNA in cells in mother's blood .\nResults will be given within days - not like the current wait of weeks .\nTest will be offered at St George's Hospital in London, and privately .\nEventually similar tests will be routinely used to reassure pregnant women ."}

The letters by Admiral L. Ramdas and Prashant Bhushan are the ones that matter, and the issues they raised should be addressed. My objection is that instead of merely raising questions, people should contribute to the party by working for it. The problems have to be, and will be, addressed. It won’t take more than a month or so for the party to set everything right. Talking about the funds, I will say let the expenses and accounts reach the office. We have fought three elections in a year, which is too much for any small party. Every single issue raised is important for the party. The only problem is that this should not be done via the media; it needs to be done by holding internal talks. Mayank Gandhi should have demanded that the recordings and the minutes be made public in the meeting which he had attended. What is the meaning of simply raising questions? Every leader needs to think about it. If a volunteer is punished when he is wrong, even leaders should be held accountable. The party’s national executive was called only to tackle the problems. The issues raised are important, and people should take the onus to set the system right and not simply raise questions or write blogs. I genuinely feel Prashantji is a very respectful person. When he made those statements, my respect (for him) went down a bit. I would definitely like to see him as a leader of the party. We don’t expect him to make a mistake at all. There is no question of his marginalisation. He should be supported for a larger, better role by everyone. Ankit Lal, Ashutosh and Khetan need to apologise sincerely for what they have done. They need to be pulled up. Every volunteer wants transparency on accounts, candidate selection and other decisions. We had six months after the Lok Sabha polls. Why didn’t those who raise questions help carve out these mechanisms then? The camp system is wrong and if it exists, it should be demolished. I do not want to comment on Yogendra Yadav at all.

Jerry Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan Thursday to tackle the state's historic drought. A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to \"manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure.\" According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis. \"This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up,\" said Brown. \"But we have a lot of good policies coming.\" To exacerbate matters, weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is at a near record low. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower. \"The drought isn't letting up, so we can't let up either,\" Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said. \"This legislation will deliver relief to Californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause. Since our skies are still clear, our job is too. And making sure we meet emergency needs, prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort.\" Brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately.

She accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at Delaware's Dover International Speedway in September. Twice, the NASCAR 2004 Cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times. That meant he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as two subsequent Sprint Cup races. But he should be able to compete through the fall, and NASCAR says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events. The case against Busch took a significant turn last week, when the Delaware Department of Justice announced that charges would not be filed against him. \"As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse,\" Busch said then. \"I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" A Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February that Busch must stay away from Driscoll for a year.

A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes. He said: ‘We prioritised genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness, ear size, subcutaneous fat and, especially, haemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen around the body).’ ‘De-extinction’ enthusiast Mr Church, who was speaking to The Sunday Times science editor Jonathan Leake, added: ‘We now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth DNA in them.’ Mammoths co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food.

Cherie Blair is set to join Renault next month to improve the diversity on its board, it has been revealed. The French car manufacturer has approached the well-known women’s rights activist as it attempts to improve its female representation. Mother-of-four Mrs Blair, 60, has been concentrating on her legal and charity work since her 61-year-old husband Tony left the office of prime minister in 2007. Renault - the world’s fourth biggest car maker by sales through its alliance with Nissan - said the barrister would also add helpful experience in employment and human rights law. Mrs Blair, who ‘works closely’ with more than 20 charities according to her website, has never previously been appointed to a French corporation, reported The Daily Telegraph. Last year she left human rights practice Matrix Chambers to join the international legal consultancy firm Omnia Stategy, which she co-founded four years ago. Mrs Blair, who was born into a working-class family in Liverpool, also founded the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, which helps female entrepreneurs in the developing world. A quota system exists in France to demand that women make up 20 per cent of board members – a figure that will rise to 40 per cent in 2017. Four of Renault’s current 19-member board are women. Other prominent women in the male-dominated industry include Ursula Piëch of Volkswagen, Mary Barra of General Motors and Patience Wheatcroft of Fiat Chrysler, reported the Financial Times.

Mrs Blair is set to be proposed as a director for four years at Renault's annual shareholders meeting on April 30, according to a list of resolutions published by the firm last Friday. Meanwhile, it was reported earlier this week that her husband is to step back from his role as Middle East peace envoy. The former Labour leader has been the envoy for the Middle East Quartet peace negotiators - the UN, the EU, Russia and the US - since he quit as prime minister.

It took him almost five years to find a publisher, but last night Rob Biddulph's persistence paid off when his first children's book won a major award. Blown Away, the magazine art director's enchanting tale about a sky-faring penguin, won the £5,000 Waterstones Children's Book Prize. It is only the second time a picture book has triumphed during the award's 11-year history. Mr Biddulph, who works for The Observer, said last night: 'I'm totally surprised at winning. It took me a while to get this book published.' Melissa Cox, chairman of the judging panel, said the author had 'a beautiful fresh style all his own'. She said: 'The test of a good picture book is not how good it is on first reading, but how enjoyable it is on its fiftieth. 'It's a beautiful fresh style that is all his own and his style of storytelling is very reminiscent of classic picture book writers like Allan Ahlberg. 'It's very unusual for a brand new illustrator to write their own text, which marked it out, and even more unusual is for them to do rhyming text.' Mr Biddulph began as an author by making up stories for his three children and illustrating them. Blown Away was named the overall winner beating two other titles which had triumphed in their categories – Half Bad by Sally Green, the best teenage book, and Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens, the best title for younger readers. Waterstones Managing director James Daunt said: 'This year we have another wonderfully inspiring Prize that is testament to the extraordinary vibrancy and creativity in children's publishing.' Penguins also captured the public imagination in the build-up to Christmas last year when the computer-generated Monty starred in the John Lewis ad campaign, with spin-off cuddly toys selling out.

'At times its work has been risky or controversial, but in our experience it has always acted with the greatest integrity,' they said in a letter to The Times.

Reacting to a howl, the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what Ramsey is trying to say. According to the Huffington Post, the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate’s dog food. There are several theories as to how dog-human communication has evolved over the years. Looking around the room, the puppy begins its high-pitched yapping while struggling to break free . Some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral, group-living wolves. While others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative. As for howling, dogs do this for a range of reasons including: locating other pack members, keeping strangers away, or calling the pack for hunting. The dog's owner Kayla Cagnola laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy Ramsey is trying to say . Dog's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance.

The actor said he chooses to bear witness to the gruesome clips, in which Americans, Britons and Kurds have been graphically slaughtered, because 'real violence' is often hidden from us. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'The problem is we are not seeing enough of real violence. We are being anesthetized when you don't see the horror of war.' 'Real violence': Sean Penn, pictured left in his new film The Gunman, said he watches ISIS's propaganda videos showing hostages like James Foley, right, being beheaded . When asked whether he felt morally obliged to view the clips, he replied that he did. Penn said that the graphic reality of the murder videos counteracts 'political correctness', which has led upsetting images from conflict such as that in Iraq and Afghanistan from being kept off-screen. He also mentioned the ISIS clips in relation to his own new movie, The Gunman, which will feature graphic violence. Penn said that staged violence in movies and the real violence such as that being perpetrated in Iraq and Syria are not the same thing. Violence in movies: Penn made a point of differentiating fictional violence, like that in his new film, above, from real-life acts by the likes of ISIS . He said: 'Anyone who sees them [ISIS videos] and claims that they were anaesthetised by violent movies, that they weren't horrified by what they saw, on the most primal level, is intellectually dishonest or existentially unpresent.' Penn has voice his opinions about ISIS before - earlier this week he told Conan O'Brien that the terrorist organization was 'created' by George W Bush and Dick Cheney. Beginning with former Vice President Cheney, whom he called 'an embittered bacteria [sic] of humanity', he said: 'These are the guys, he and President Bush and some others, who invented Daesh, or ISIS.' The video ends with three ISIS fighters pulling out their knives and beheading their prisoner. Close up shots of the bloodied bodies are shown. He sarcastically added 'thanks for that'. Meanwhile ISIS continues to produce and distribute sickening videos of its barbaric executions. Its warped criminal justice system has given rise to footage of people thrown off buildings for being homosexual, and having hands amputated for other crimes. On Friday its latest beheading video was released, showing the killing of three Kurdish soldiers who had been taken prisoner.", "completion": "response:\n\nActor advocates watches videos because people are 'anesthetized'\nSaid graphic murder videos from Syria counteract 'political correctness'"}

The rally, called \"Israel Wants Change,\" was put on by One Million Hands, a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues: a two-state solution and a reduction in the cost of living. On both of these topics, founder Dror Ben-Ami says, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed. \"We think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office. To get Bibi out of office,\" says Ben-Ami. Organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the March 17 balloting. Instead, they are encouraging voters to change the current administration. Police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people. Headlining the rally was Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and a vocal critic of Netanyahu. In recent weeks, Dagan criticized Netanyahu's decision to speak before the U.S. Congress, and he continued his criticism at the rally, saying that he has never seen such stagnation in Israeli politics. Netanyahu still has broad support in Israel, and his Likud party is doing well in the polls. The Zionist Union is Likud's primary challenger. In the initial round of polling immediately following Netanyahu's speech before Congress, the Zionist Union was expected to win 24 seats in the Knesset while Likud was expected to win 23 seats. The poll comes from CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel. Because of the nature of Israeli politics, Netanyahu's Likud party could lose the election while Netanyahu still becomes prime minister. In many ways, this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011. Hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of Tel Aviv, demanding improvements in the cost of housing, education, and health care. What started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities. This time, the issues are different.

While the rest of the English Super League clubs spend two or even three nights on their annual trips to the south of France, the Rhinos charter their own plane to get them in and out of the city on the day of the game. It is a move that has paid off so far, with Brian McDermott's men winning on each of their last three trips to the Stade Gilbert Brutus, and the coach believes it could be even more important this time with the hectic Easter programme coming up. Leeds Rhinos boss Brian McDermott set for clash with Catalan Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday . 'There's a lot of meticulous planning involved but it's something we prefer to do and it's a more efficient way of doing it,' McDermott said. 'Sometimes we don't treat our players as robustly as they should be treated, certainly in terms of travel. 'It's worked well for us. I don't think travelling on the day of the game is as detrimental as you would imagine, although I wouldn't do it every single weekend. 'What it does do is help you recover for the following game. The players get to spend the night before they travel in their own bed and on the night of the game they're back in their own bed again, albeit later than normal.' The Dragons have also chartered their own plane for trips to England but they spent last week in Manchester to take in back-to-back away games against the two Hull clubs. Brad Singleton of Leeds Rhinos scores his teams third try of the game against Wigan last week . That exercise can only be described as a failure after Laurent Frayssinous' men lost both games, conceding 83 points in the process, but McDermott expects them to be back to their formidable best back on French soil, where they are unbeaten so far this year. 'I am sure they will be good,' McDermott said. 'They'll be determined to turn things around. Every team has a tussle with them when they go out there.' Saturday's meeting between the clubs will be the first since the Catalans ended Leeds' play-off hopes with a dramatic 24-20 triumph at Headingley last September. Leeds are still without skipper Kevin Sinfield, as well as prop Kylie Leuluai and winger Tom Briscoe, so Liam Sutcliffe, Ash Handley and Andy Yates keep their places following the win over Wigan. Frayssinous recalls half-back Scott Dureau and threequarters Ben Pomeroy - who has completed a one-match ban - and Mathias Pala to take the places of Todd Carney, Vincent Duport and Michael Oldfield, who were all injured in the defeat at Hull FC.", "completion": "response:\n\nLeeds Rhinos face Catalan Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday .\nFirst meeting since Dragons ended Leeds play-off hopes last year ."}

Ever since motorised travel first came into use in the 19th century people with  knowledge of the roads and attractions have charged willing passengers for their services. Despite all the different types of transportation, be it a cab, tup tup, jeepney or jitney, we are all bound and aided by a common service: the humble taxi. As of March 14, 2014, in New York City, there are 51,398 men and women licensed to drive yellow taxicabs . With the first taxi carriage services starting to emerge in 1897, transportation was often rickety, slow and motorless, with both driver and passenger unsure of the correct fare price. The boom of industry in the 19th century resulted in motorised methods replacing animal taxis, although this is still common in areas of the world where vehicles would be impractical. These include husky-propelled sledges, camels in the Sahara or elephant rides in Asia. Even the prices vary dramatically, with haggling being common place in Peru, and taxi-sharing being popular in Nigeria. Fares can be calculated per mile, with some of the most expensive being London's hackney carriage cabs at £2.56, compared to £0.30 per mile in India's equivalent.

Called aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere, the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived Tuesday about 10 a.m. ET (1 a.m. Wednesday in Sydney). Both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the Earth, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. \"When these particles bombard the Earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, the collision often creates brilliant colors,\" Borek said. \"Most of the time, auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint, which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on Earth.\" Share your photos of the aurora with iReport . The stronger the storm, the farther south it can be seen, said Borek. And this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful, reaching as a high as a G4 on a scale from 1 to 5 Tuesday night, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours, and NOAA's latest reports say it's down to a G1. Though the storm could affect GPS technology and power grids, NOAA said Tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions. The most visible impact as been this stunning light display. If the auroras are seen again tonight, Borek said, they won't be as pronounced and most likely won't reach as far south as Tuesday night. People in northern Michigan, northern Minnesota and Maine may be able to spot them, although he warned that clouds from Minnesota to Montana may impede visibility Wednesday night.", "completion": "response:\n\nA particularly strong solar storm created a stunning light display .\nStronger storms can be seen farther south, CNN meteorologist says .\nSome in northern U.S. may see lights again tonight ."}

Jose Mourinho is a confirmed admirer of the France international centre-back and is willing to test Real Madrid's resolve to hold onto the 21-year-old. Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea need a commanding centre-half like Raphael Varane . Varane is valued at £40million by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and was signed after being persuaded by Zinedine Zidane that Madrid was where his future lay. However, Varane has grown frustrated this year with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit. Manchester United are also keeping tabs on Varane after losing out to Real Madrid in 2011. Real Madrid have slapped a £40m price tag on French defender Varane . Age: 21 . Appearances: Lens 23/Goals 2; . Real Madrid 76 (20)/5; France 17/1 . Varane has been labelled Real Madrid's Lion and former France defender Frank Leboeuf believes he has the potential to be better than Real Madrid legend Fernando Hierro . Varane signed a new six-year contract at the start of the season . The 21-year-old has grown frustrated with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit . Sir Alex Ferguson was keen to sign him from Lens and the Old Trafford club will challenge for his signature again should Madrid show a willingness to deal. Mourinho has concerns about the centre of his defence. Gary Cahill has sometimes looked uneasy against European opposition while John Terry is 34. Kurt Zouma has done well this season but is still inexperienced and Varane is already an assured performer at international level. Chelsea captain Terry will be given a new one year contract while Branislav Ivanovic, who is 31, has 16 months left on contract. The Blues also have Andreas Christensen and Tomas Kalas in reserve but both lack big game experience. Jose Mourinho has concerns over John Terry and Gary Cahill in the centre of his defence .

The Magpies are 11th in the Premier League table having escaped with a 1-0 win over relegation threatened Aston Villa on Saturday.

'Newcastle fans at the minute are showing why they are some of the best around, because they can't dream. They've been told the cups aren't a priority, that finishing 10th in the Premier League is more important.'

He claimed that a burglar had brought the bantam cockerel and had placed it in the trap - but his argument was thrown out by the district judge. The court was told that the cockerel 'was very lucky to have pulled through from a terrible act of cruelty.' The bird had survived the ordeal and, according to the RSPCA inspector, 'is now living the happy, healthy life that he deserves.' Wells was found guilty of using a live bird as a decoy for the purpose of killing or taking a wild animal and causing unnecessary suffering to ananimal.

Now, scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage – at least when it comes to salaries. A study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Despite working just as hard, they are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked. Researchers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers' productivity and pay. A University of Sheffield study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues . Their study found: 'More agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market, but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting.' They defined agreeableness as being compliant, modest, trustworthy and sympathetic. The study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits, perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap. Being agreeable made workers more successful in team work, but had three negative effects on their performance. Friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked, according to the study . 'First, helping others may reduce individual productivity,' the study found. 'Secondly, agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage. Finally, agreeable individuals may enter less stable, lower paid occupations.' The study was presented at the Royal Economic Society's 2015 annual conference in Manchester yesterday by Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of The University of Sheffield, who conducted the research alongside Australian and Spanish academics. They analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the University of New South Wales in laboratory conditions, and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages. It found that, while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money, being too open could harm your career. While openness with colleagues indicated an artistic, curious and imaginative worker, it could make them less likely to obey the rules, which could cause problems at a formal workplace. Neuroticism, which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability, also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self-confidence and were insecure.", "completion": "response:\n\nStudy found friendly staff receive lower wages than unpleasant colleagues .\nThey are often reluctant to push for pay rise and too focused on team work .\nUniversity of Sheffield researchers looked at impact of personality traits ."}

SAE's national chapter suspended the students, but University of Oklahoma President David Boren took it a step further, saying the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done. The news is shocking, but it's not the first time SAE has faced controversy. SAE was founded March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama, five years before the American Civil War, according to the fraternity website. When the war began, the group had fewer than 400 members, of which \"369 went to war for the Confederate States and seven for the Union Army,\" the website says. The fraternity now boasts more than 200,000 living alumni, along with about 15,000 undergraduates populating 219 chapters and 20 \"colonies\" seeking full membership at universities. SAE has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths, many blamed on the hazing of new recruits, SAE national President Bradley Cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity's website. The fraternity's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for \"health and safety incidents\" since 2010. At least 30 of the incidents involved hazing, and dozens more involved alcohol. However, the list is missing numerous incidents from recent months. Among them, according to various media outlets: Yale University banned the SAEs from campus activities last month after members allegedly tried to interfere with a sexual misconduct investigation connected to an initiation rite. Stanford University in December suspended SAE housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content. And Johns Hopkins University in November suspended the fraternity for underage drinking. \"The media has labeled us as the 'nation's deadliest fraternity,' \" Cohen said. In 2011, for example, a student died while being coerced into excessive alcohol consumption, according to a lawsuit. SAE's previous insurer dumped the fraternity. \"As a result, we are paying Lloyd's of London the highest insurance rates in the Greek-letter world,\" Cohen said. Universities have turned down SAE's attempts to open new chapters, and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents.", "completion": "response:\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon is being tossed out by the University of Oklahoma .\nIt's also run afoul of officials at Yale, Stanford and Johns Hopkins in recent months ."}

Having a group of athletic, testosterone-fuelled players surrounding you, trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them, is almost too much to bear.

We know that we have got a good side.’ Things looked difficult when Oleg Gusev opened the scoring for Kiev, who have now failed to win in England in 12 attempts, but they struggled to contain Lukaku, who scored his seventh Europa League goal of the campaign.

Now we have to focus on the league as we are not doing too well. ‘Everyone up front was scared to have the ball and we put the defenders and the midfielders in danger, but after 20 minutes we improved.

The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time, and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome. The move will see a return to the days of Dr No, when Sean Connery as 007 meets the voluptuous Sylvia Trench at Le Cercle club, languidly puts a Morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line: ‘Bond. James Bond.’ The name's Bond - James Bond: Sean Connery, as 007, lights up a cigarette in a casino in 1962's Dr No . Today, the suave spy would be liable for prosecution for breaking the smoking ban – the reason why a roof garden extension is being added to the hotel’s Park Lane Casino for its aptly named ‘high rollers’. David Mills, the hotel’s operations director, said: ‘Many of our clients come from countries where smoking bans do not apply. We want to provide them with a relaxing and enjoyable experience.’ Gaming tables will be placed on the terrace so that roulette, blackjack, baccarat and three-card poker can be played under the stars, although Westminster Council has banned live and recorded music in case it disturbs nearby residents.

Earlier this year, Mariam Aziz, the former wife of the world’s richest man, the Sultan of Brunei, described in court how she went on ‘reckless gambling sprees’ in Mayfair.

Fifteen secondary school pupils were rushed off the vehicle when its driver realised there were flames coming from its rear wheel. No one was hurt in the incident, with fire fighters called to the scene in Radlett, Hertfordshire, as rush hour traffic piled up. Fifteen schoolchildren were evacuated from the bus when it caught fire on its way to a secondary school in Barnet, north London . The blaze was put out within half an hour after witnesses shared photographs of black smoke filtering through the sky from miles away. The man driving the bus, which belonged to Little Bus Company, has been praised for safely getting the children out in time.

'As soon as it was noticed, the driver stopped, got everyone off incredibly quickly and we’re very glad no-one was hurt.

City initially denied the charge but were on Friday found guilty of 'failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion'. The incident was brought about by the reaction of a number of Hull players after Alex Bruce was booked by referee Jon Moss following a tackle on Riyad Mahrez. Hull City were charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion . Alex Bruce reacted furiously to being booked by referee Jon Ross for a  challenge on Riyad Mahrez . The findings are something of an embarrassment for Hull, whose manager Steve Bruce criticised the Leicester players for their conduct during the nervy 0-0 draw. He was unimpressed by what he perceived to be attempts to persuade Moss to penalise his son. 'I saw everyone surround Alex (asking) for a red card for his challenge,' he said in the post-match press conference. 'The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we're going to go down the route of every other league - jumping around and whingeing and trying to get people yellow and red cards - for me that's not right.' Hull City manager Steve Bruce was unhappy with the behaviour of Leicester's players . Hull were handed six bookings in the match, two of which led to Tom Huddlestone's sending-off. Foxes boss Nigel Pearson tersely described Bruce's version as 'not a fair assessment' and the FA's independent regulatory commission were in agreement, attributing blame to the Hull contingent. Their statement read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, Hull City have been fined £30,000 after an FA player misconduct charge brought against the club was found proven. 'It was alleged that in or around the 68th minute of the game against Leicester City on 14 March 2015, Hull failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion.

A sanitation worker in an Atlanta suburb already served two weekends in jail -- and faced several more until officials relented Monday-- after authorities charged him for doing his job too early in the morning. Kevin McGill, a garbage collector in Sandy Springs, Georgia, had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city's noise ordinance that states that \"trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.\" He was cited one recent morning after starting work about 5 a.m. McGill said that when he appeared in court, he was \"stunned\" when he learned he'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early. \"The solicitor said, 'It's automatic jail time,'\" McGill told CNN affiliate WSB. McGill said it was the first time he'd violated the ordinance, but the solicitor \"didn't want to hear nothing I had to say.\" \"I was shocked,\" McGill told WSB. City spokeswoman Sharon Kraun said McGill appeared in court with his employer and agreed to a plea deal, which included a 30-day jail sentence. The court said the sentence could be served on weekends, and Kraun confirmed Monday that McGill already spent two weekends behind bars. After news of McGill's punishment went viral, the solicitor's office announced Monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence, saying in a statement, \"The actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill's sentence for violating the city's noise laws was disproportionate to a first-time offense.\" \"As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation (is) suspended,\" the statement said. Chief prosecutor Bill Riley told WSB that the jail sentence was his idea because, he said, \"fines don't seem to work.\" \"The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail,\" McGill said. Still, McGill said being locked up with \"real criminals\" was hard, and so was being away from his family. \"I just want this to be over with,\" he told WSB before getting word of the \"time served\" adjustment. \"I'm away from my family, my wife, and she's got to take care of the two little boys and I have four dogs.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nKevin McGill was initially ordered to serve 30 days in jail for picking up trash too early in the morning .\nMcGill already began his sentence, doing two weekends behind bars .\nCity relents, letting him off with \"time served\" after story goes viral ."}

Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . ‘I can totally understand there is an image around that, and in the British game and our society it’s not something that is accepted, and rightly so,’ Evans told The Times. ‘But I was able to go home and look my mum and dad in the eye because if I’d genuinely spat at someone I think they would have been disgusted in me. ‘It’s not the background I come from in Northern Ireland.

Egypt is ready to ditch Cairo and build a shiny new capital  if the government has its way. Fed up with pollution, traffic gridlock, a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure, Egypt is teaming up with a developer in the United Arab Emirates to build a city in what could be one of the world's most ambitious infrastructure programs. The yet-to-be-named city will spread out over 150 square miles, or roughly the size of Denver, and could eventually be home to 7 million people, the developers and government announced Friday. The current capital of Cairo, while full of history and vibrant charm, is home to more than 18 million people, and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating. The government says the idea is to reduce congestion in Cairo, which is projected to double in population in the coming decades. An exact location was not announced, but the city is expected to be built east of Cairo. It will be closer to the Red Sea -- between two major highways -- the Suez and the Ain Sokhna roads. The ambitions are big. In addition to the new embassies and government buildings, it plans to have an international airport bigger than Heathrow, solar energy farms, 40,000 hotel rooms,  nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals --  all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads. But if the dream is big, the bill will be bigger. The total cost is estimated at U.S. $45 billion, Minister of Housing Mostafa Madbouly announced at an economic development conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The unveiling of the new capital was paired with a glitzy website with renderings showing a lush and technological urban scape of glass towers and pools. The plan is backed by a group that describes itself as \"a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships\" led by Emirati developer Mohamed Alabbar. Alabbar made his name as the founder of Dubai's Emaar Properties, primarily known for developing the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Egypt is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures.  Myanmar has only recently completed its move from crumbling Yangon to the new city of Naypyidaw. Nigeria moved to Abuja in the 1990's, and Brazil carved its capital Brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago. And then there was another crazy idea of building a capital on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators at the time. That city?

He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust . Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been convicted  of unlawfully accepting money from a U.S. supporter in a retrial of corruption charges. The 69-year-old accepted around £104,000 ($153,950) from Morris Talansky while he was a cabinet minister, Jerusalem District Court heard. He could now be given five years in prison - in addition to a six-year sentence he received in 2014 for a separate bribery conviction. His lawyers said they are likely to appeal the latest ruling. Following the verdict Uri Korev, prosecuting, said: 'His behaviour constitutes a breach of trust which harms the public, harms morality and harms the public's trust in how he behaved corruptly.' Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use without reporting it, the judges concluded. He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust. Eyal Rozovsky, Olmert's lawyer, said their legal team was 'of course very disappointed' by the ruling. Olmert resigned in early 2009 amid corruption allegations. He was originally acquitted in 2012 of a series of charges including accepting cash-stuffed envelopes from Talansky while he was mayor of Jerusalem. He received around £406,000 ($600,000) from the U.S. businessman but there was no evidence the money had been used for unlawful person reasons or illegal campaign financing, the court said. At the time Olmert was convicted on a lesser charge of breach of trust after steering job appointments and contracts to clients of a business partner. Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use, the judges concluded. A retrial was organised after Zaken became a state witness, offering diary entries and tape recordings of conversations with Olmert about illicitly receiving cash. In a separate trial in March 2014 Olmert was convicted of bribery  and was sentenced to six years in prison. He appealed and has been allowed to stay out of jail until a verdict is delivered. The judges must now decide if Olmert should serve additional prison time for today's conviction or whether his six-year sentence is enough  for both offences, legal expert Emanuel Gross said. A decision is likely to be made in May.", "completion": "response:\n\nEhud Olmert accepted around £104,000 ($153,950) from Morris Talansky .\nGave an aide part of the money in exchange for loyalty, judges decided .\n69-year-old convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust ."}

And what’s better than helium for distorting your voice to make you sound like a friendly chipmunk? Well, for baby Lincoln, the answer appears to be anything. Filmed sitting on what seems to be his mother’s lap, Lincoln, who appears to be from America, is joined by his uncle Carson, who holds a purple balloon. After inhaling the helium, Carson says: ‘Hey Lincoln, how are you?’ in a sinister high-pitched voice while looking at his nephew.

As his uncle starts giggling like a chipmunk it all becomes too much for baby Lincoln and he bursts into tears. So far so good: Lincoln sits on what appears to be his mother's lap while his uncle inhales helium from a purple balloon .

The Swede was at the time caught on camera saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country.

French sports minister Patrick Kanner had called on Ibrahimovic to apologise, which he later did in a social media post, and the mercurial forward has once again played down the impact of his rant. At a press conference ahead of Sweden's Euro 2016 qualifier against Moldova, Ibrahimovic, in quotes reported in the Swedish media, said: 'I like it in France. 'I would not have played there for so long and I would not have renewed my contract if I did not like it.

The Sweden striker has called for greater emphasis on referees, noting that they do not get punished . Ibrahimovic does, however, want a greater emphasis placed on referees, adding: 'We the players are punished, but not the referee.' While Ibrahimovic did score a hat-trick for PSG against Lorient in the last round of Ligue 1 fixtures before the international break, he is set to miss their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Barcelona after his sending off against Chelsea. His tackle on Oscar earned him a straight red, though PSG did progress in the end, but Ibrahimovic feels the Brazilian had played his part in the referee's decision.

But one couple got more than they bargained for when they came head to head with an American bison - also referred to as a buffalo - while on the road. In the clip the car can be seen waiting in anticipation – indicator sounding – as a herd of three bison come galloping slowly towards it. Getting closer and closer, the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper. Reacting, the filmmaker exclaims: ‘Don’t run into our car,’ just as the bison crashes into it – the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap. Shocked, a lady in the car laughs as the man readjusts the camera and begins filming the two remaining bison, who look quite content standing sideways in the middle of the road. As the bison gets  closer it shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper . Speaking about the incident, the filmmaker said: ‘I thought the bison would simply run by our car at a full clip. 'Instead, at the last minute, the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head-butts our car. There was nothing we could do to avoid being hit.’ He added: 'It was fortunate that the car was turned off, since a head-on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph  would  likely cause the airbags to deploy.' As the filmmaker calls for the bison not to run into the car it continues charging forward and makes contact with it . Readjusting the camera, which was thrown up and then down by the impact, the video maker captures the bison waking away . Yellowstone is the only place in America where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times and as a result the area is home to the nation’s largest bison population on public land. Known for being agile despite their size, as well as aggressive, Bison can charge at up to 35mph. The bison population in Yellowstone is estimated at 4,600 in two breeding herds.

The report said that Han, 30, was approached by a person claiming to be a journalist via the instant messaging app WeChat. The \"reporter\" assigned Han to work in a military base, taking photos of \"sensitive areas\" of a major military project with his phone in the name of news gathering.

You're supposed to do a video, of course, and challenge others to do the same for a good cause. The ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" a fundraiser for autism programs. A tweet from sportscaster Fred Katz challenged the \"Today\" show's Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays  Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" to share a \"Lady and the Tramp\" licorice. It took off from there.  Next thing you knew, Geist was repeating the stunt with Meredith Vieira and the #TwizzlerChallenge was on. Geist and Vieira challenged Matt Lauer and Kathy Lee Gifford.  They were good sports about it, but you may want to close your eyes here.  This isn't for the faint of heart. The challenge is starting to invade social media.  Just search the hashtag #TwizzlerChallenge. It sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at Twizzlers.  Their candy is on the lips of America. And to their credit, a couple of Twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $10,000. The money goes to New York Collaborates for Autism.  The group funds and creates schools, programs and services for people with autism nationwide. Since 2006, \"Night of Too Many Stars\" has raised over $22 million.

Nadal has been hampered by injury and illness since his Roland Garros triumph last June and lost out to Fabio Fognini in the semifinals of the Rio Open last week. It was a dispiriting defeat -- his first in a clay-court semifinal for 12 years -- but, moving from Brazil to Argentina, the Spaniard was largely untroubled in reaching the final and duly swept aside home player Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1 in the Estadio Billoch Caride.

The official said 29-year-old Liban Mohamed is currently in Somali custody. He would not describe what efforts would be made to bring Mohamed to the United States for trial. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he is not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. Mohamed is charged with providing material support to al-Qaeda and al-Shabab and is one of about 30 people on the terrorist list.

Mohamed was formerly a cabdriver, The Washington Post reports, and is suspected of having helped in operations in al-Shabab as well as recruiting new members. Anonymous sources told the press he was well-versed regarding potential targets in Washington. 'While living in Northern Virginia, Mohamed was a recruiter and radicalizer for al Shabaab, which historically has targeted Westerners to go to Somalia and fight for them,' Ghattas said.

Jennifer Becker, 49, from Edgecomb, was arrested Monday and charged with furnishing marijuana and endangering the welfare of a child. The woman was taken into custody after the Maine Department of Health and Human Services received a complaint claiming that Becker gave her underage daughter baked goods containing cannabis. The divorced mother of one was taken to the Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset and later released on bail. A judge has ordered Becker to avoid contact with her 13-year-old daughter, who is now staying with her father in Florida. The mother is due back in court in April, reported Portland Herald Press. On her Facebook page, Becker listed her occupation as a hemp farmer; hemp is a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant and its related products. She is also a member of the New England HempCrete - a company that offers environmentally friendly building materials made out of hemp. Blame game: Becker said her daughter, who 'has issues' told her therapist about the pot-laced brownies, which eventually resulted in her arrest . In an interview with the local station WGME, Becker said her teenage daughter ‘has issues’ and that everything is ‘being blown out of proportion.’ ‘She confided to her therapist that she took some [pot brownies] and now here we are,’ the 49-year-old suspect stated. Maine legalized medical marijuana in 1999, and a decade later the state decriminalized cannabis when Governor John Baldacci signed a bill which made possession of 2.5 ounces or less a civil infraction. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form.

But this motorcyclist cut it a little too close as his bike crept out onto a main road, straight into the path of a speeding lorry. The terrifying footage, captured by a dashboard camera in Khabarovsk, Russia, shows the moment the man's bike is swept away under the wheels of the lorry – but the rider miraculously escapes with his life. The moped rider looks tentative from the start of the clip as he eventually makes his way to the front of the queue of cars . Captured at the start of the clip, the man on the moped appears to attempt braking as he reaches the junction but seems to lose control and move forward further than expected. The car, recording the footage from behind the bike, shows the moment it jumps forward, straight into the path of the oncoming lorry. Hitting the lorry’s back wheels, the bike is pulled away from underneath its rider as his head is thrown back violently by the impact. Suddenly the moped rider appears to lose control and speeds up, crashing into the side of the moving lorry . The moped’s top box is also hurled down the road by the lorry and more worryingly so is the man’s helmet, which becomes detached during the crash. As the bike lands mangled in front of the first car waiting at the junction, fuel begins leaking from it and onto the road. Remarkably however the man almost immediately appears from the wreckage and jogs back to the side road. The impact from the crash with the lorry forces the man's head backwards and throws the moped down the road . His t-shirt appears to be ripped and he throws himself down onto the floor as a pedestrian approaches him to see if he is okay. The filmmaker reverses his car and the man – who writhes on the floor, seemingly more in shock than pain – comes back into the shot. According to the video uploaded online, the man was lucky to escape the accident with only scratches.

The company said Monday that it's recalling 3 oz. institutional/food service cups of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream after a test detected listeria in one of the cups recovered from a Kansas hospital. There have been no illnesses reported from the cups, Blue Bell said. The contaminated cup was produced at a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, in April 2014, the company said. Earlier this month the company recalled a group of products that were made at a plant in Texas as Kansas health officials said three people had died in the past year from a listeria outbreak that could be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products. A total of five people have contracted the serious infection in Kansas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had eaten milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" Listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC.

In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year; approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth. The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This is the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said.

Trainee Detective Constable Amy Beautridge said: 'This was a most unusual crime and distressing crime, during which the two young victims were terrified by threats made by the suspect, who intimated he was in possession of a knife. 'He used their fear to control them and force them to effectively do as he said.' She added: 'Despite their young age, the victims have been incredibly brave in coming forward and providing information to the police and I would praise them for this.'

Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of an ambitious ‘rewilding’ scheme. Although the animals would be introduced onto privately owned estates, the woodland would be unfenced, meaning the 70lb animals could roam free around the countryside. Lynx could be introduced into the UK countryside for the first time in 1,300 years, it emerged yesterday . Scientists argue that introducing lynx will benefit the ecosystem, by helping control the 1million UK deer population, as well as boosting the tourist economy. But the move is controversial and likely to be opposed by farmers worried about the animals savaging their livestock and game birds. Under the plan, devised by the Lynx Trust, four to six cats would be released at each site. Around the size of a large dog and with powerful claws for climbing, they will be released into areas rich in deer and trees and each will wear a tracking device so their movements can be monitored. Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of a ‘rewilding’ scheme . The Trust said it would be launching a public consultation this week, before applying to the Government via Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) for formal permission. Paul O’Donoghue, a science adviser to the Lynx Trust, said: ‘The lynx is a magical animal that last roamed Great Britain [at least] 1,300 years ago. ‘It is one of the most beautiful cats on the planet and its absence makes Britain a poorer place.’ But a spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said money could be better spent elsewhere. ‘We would be concerned about the reintroduction due to its high cost and failure risk,’ he said. ‘We believe budgets are better focused on developing existing biodiversity.’ While Ron Macdonald, policy director of SNH, who would have to licence the reintroduction, said they also had concerns. ‘There are pluses and minuses to reintroducing any species,’ he said. ‘Lynx could help reduce deer numbers in Scottish woodlands but some land-use organisations have concerns about the impact of a reintroduction on livestock.’", "completion": "response:\n\nExperts want to release lynx in woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Scotland .\nIt would be first time big cats were wild in UK countryside for 1,300 years .\nWoodland would be unfenced, meaning the 70lb animals could roam free .\nThe controversial is move likely to be opposed by Britain's farmers ."}

A Serbian woman asked doctors to vouch for her virginity after she was dogged by accusations of affairs with a former boss and other colleagues. Zumreta Strsevic, 30, chief accountant at the Cultural Centre in the western town of Prijepolje, said she was fed up with hearing rumours about her sex life come back to her. So she proved she didn't have one by commissioning a report from a gynaecologist which conclusively proved her virginity was still intact. It is now evidence in a claim against her workplace. 'It got so bad that it was becoming impossible to do the job properly,' she was quoted as saying by Central European News. 'So I decided the only way to prove I wasn't sleeping with other people I was supposedly having an affair with us to prove that actually I've never slept with anyone.' She told Serbian news website Blic that she realises the gynaecologist's findings means she will be subject to a new whispering campaign, but said she felt she had to do it to protect her honour. 'I don't care the price I'll pay to save face,' she said. 'I don't want to be drawn into their dirty games, and if they find any evidence of my alleged dishonest behaviour I'll leave work without saying anything.' Rumours about Miss Strsevic's sex life spread so far they were even brought up at a meeting of Prijepolje's Municipal Council, Blic reported.

A £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child. The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin. The Queen - the baby's great-grandmother - approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19. Thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days. The Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver crown-sized £5 coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, which cost £800 each. Both featured the prince's namesake St George. Babies born on the same day as George were also entitled to receive one of 2,013 free 'lucky' silver pennies. When George turned one, the occasion was also marked by a commemorative £5 coin - making him the first member of the royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin.

Its scientific name is Peckoltia greedoi, and it is known for its large, dark eyes, puckered lips and protruding bristles. But you can call him Greedo, in honor of the bounty hunter from \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.\" You might remember him from the cantina scene on Mos Eisley, where he was killed by Han Solo while attempting to collect on a debt for Jabba the Hutt. \"I think it was the whole package that evoked Greedo, but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth,\" said Jonathan Armbruster, biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the Auburn University Museum of Natural History. Armbruster made the connection in September with colleagues David Werneke, Milton Tan and Chris Hamilton. But, like many things in academia, it took a while to make it official. The specimens were found in 1998 by researchers along the Gurupi River in Brazil. Armbruster obtained them in 2005 from a museum in Porto Alegre for a manuscript he was preparing on the genus, \"thinking they were unusual.\" He designated them as another existing species, Peckoltia vittata, in a 2008 paper, \"although I had not been comfortable with that designation.\" He examined them again in September and discovered they were different from Peckoltia vittata. After talking it over with his colleagues, they realized he was a clear ringer for Greedo. \"As a 7-year-old kid, I watched \"Star Wars\" in the theater, and it was a life-changing experience for me,\" said Armbruster. \"I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. Greedo has always been a personal favorite of mine.\" Greedo became the object of controversy when Lucasfilm re-released the original Star Wars trilogy in 1997. A reworked scene showed Greedo firing a shot at Solo before Solo fired back. In the 1977 release, Han is the only one to fire, prompting backlash from fans and giving rise to the phrase \"Han Shot First.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nCatfish with large, dark eyes and puckered lips named after bounty hunter Greedo .\nGreedo is the bounty hunter killed by Han Solo in \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\""}

Vladimir Putin has admitted that he was ready to place his nuclear attack forces on alert when he seized Crimea a year ago. The Russian president's revelation was aired in a pre-recorded TV interview broadcast at the end of last week. In the documentary – titled Crimea: Way Back Home – he claimed the area was Russia's 'historic territory', even though under international law it remains Ukrainian. Putin went on to say: 'Russian people live there, they are in danger and we cannot leave them.' He also claimed that he feared they would have been overrun by 'a nationalist bulldozer' from Kiev, and said he could not have left the area and the people who live there 'to whims of fate'. However the president explained that he knew the West could have intervened, and had been 'ready' to put his nuclear arsenal on alert, adding: 'I talked with colleagues and told them that Crimea is our historic territory. We were ready to do it.' The Kremlin has since claimed it has the right to station nuclear weapons on the Crimean peninsula. Yesterday's interview came a full ten days after Putin was last seen in public, amid rumours of illness, a coup, or his Olympic gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabayeva giving birth to a child in Switzerland.

However, when asked by Mr Lemon why he joined the KKK, he then attacked the news anchor, saying: 'By people like yourself who said I couldn't stand up for my people.' The interview saw people criticise CNN and Mr Lemon on Twitter for giving a plaftform to an organisation with such views.

But the bubble may be bursting, with many put off by ever larger ships, having to fly abroad to the first port, and cost. Others may be deterred by health scares such as food poisoning or ebola. The CLIA said it was the first fall in a decade with a major factor being a lack of holidays starting in Britain or Europe meaning travellers had to fly further to pick up their cruise. That may change this year with the launch of several routes from ports like Southampton, including the massive liner Britannia christened by The Queen last week. The fall also means Britain loses its places as Europe's biggest cruisers, overtaken by the 1.77 million Germans who took a seabound voyage last year.

We all find noise annoying – but if it really bothers you it could be because you're a genius. Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin and Franz Kafka – who both complained of their difficulty of filtering out noise – research has revealed. Psychologists now believe that an inability to shut out irrelevant sensory information could be strongly linked to creativity. French writer Marcel Proust was famous for wearing earplugs and lining his bedroom with cork to block out the outside sound while he worked. And Kafka once said 'I need solitude for my writing; not \"like a hermit\" - that wouldn't be enough - but like a dead man.' Darwin and write Anton Chekhov were also known to have complained about how they found it difficult to filter out noise. Scientists at Northwestern University, Illinois, tested 100 people on their ability to find original solutions to problems and found strong links between an inability to shut out irrelevant audio stimuli, dubbed 'leaky' sensory gating, and creativity. In tests 100 people were provided solutions to scenarios, with the challenge of coming up with as many original answers as possible. This was designed to measure their level of 'real world creative achievement'. The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychologia, suggest those with the affliction might find it easier to think creatively as they can focus on a wide range of things simultaneously. Darya Zabelina, a PhD psychology student at Northwestern University in Illinois said: 'If funnelled in the right direction, these sensitivities can make life more rich and meaningful, giving experiences more subtlety.'", "completion": "response:\n\nInability to shut out irrelevant sounds could be linked to creativity .\nBeing overly sensitive to sounds could be key to genius, scientists say .\nCharles Darwin among great minds who complained about too much noise ."}

Waitrose will stock the Chichester glasshouse-grown Diamond Jubilee berries from today, claiming it is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March. The berries are grown in glasshouses by Harry Hall, who supplied the supermarket with the first strawberries of the season earlier this month. The early delivery is thanks to the weather this winter, which the Met Office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929 . Laurence Olins, of industry body British Summer Fruits, said: 'This is probably the earliest we've seen English raspberries.' Waitrose raspberry buyer Nicki Baggott said: 'It's incredibly unusual to have these ready in March, but a combination of growing techniques and perfect weather means we can sell these juicy delights earlier than ever.' Just 200kg of the berries are expected this week, but there should be around a tonne produced every week afterwards.

Woods' name was conspicuously absent when the list of players for the  Houston event next week was posted on Friday. Should Woods decide to tee it up at the Masters, which starts on April 9, he would do so after not competing for 63 days. Woods, the 14-time major winner, has struggled to find any form this year . A four-time Masters champion whose ranking has plummeted to 96th, Woods has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour and said he would not return until his game was 'tournament-ready'. He missed the Masters last year for the first time in his career after being advised by doctors to have back surgery and his participation next month is in serious doubt given his struggle for form and fitness. Woods posted the highest score of his professional career, a mind-boggling 11-over-par 82, to miss the cut at the Phoenix Open in January, and many pundits believe he is suffering from the chipping 'yips'. He withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines early last month after 11 holes because of tightness in his back, and he is still adapting to the fifth swing change of his career. Woods is currently on an indefinite break from the sport but aims to qualify for the 2016 Ryder Cup . Earlier this week, Woods' good friend Notah Begay III rated the former world number one's chances of taking part in the Masters as '50-50'. 'It's literally a 50-50 chance right now from what I can tell,' said Begay, a television analyst with Golf Channel who played with Woods on the Stanford University golf team. 'That's far better odds than what it was, say, three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, I would have said there was maybe a 1-in-10 chance of him playing at Augusta.' One thing in Woods' favour is his huge comfort factor at Augusta National where in 2010 he tied for fourth at the Masters after not playing competitive golf for five months. He took an indefinite break from the game in late 2009, as his private life spectacularly unravelled, to try to repair his marriage amid revelations about his extra-marital affairs. 'He knows his way around the Augusta,' Northern Irish world number Rory McIlroy said earlier this month. 'If he feels ready to play and he does play then he knows what to do when there.' Tiger Woods struggled for form during the Waste Management Phoenix Open back in January .", "completion": "response:\n\nInjury-hit Tiger Woods has played only twice on the 2014-15 PGA Tour .\nWoods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open early last month .\nFormer world No 1 has seen his ranking plummet to 96th ."}

Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo’s unpaid bill is part of the £62million cost of ‘health tourism’ to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. New mother: Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo (left) was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter (right) on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the maternity suite . The mother said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told The Sunday Times it was ‘unfair’ she was still being pursued, because the baby’s father is British. She said: ‘I know the system may believe I travelled [to Britain] to abuse the NHS benefits, but as a matter of fact I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that.’ The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013.

The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. It means the UK is now paying out £15 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors.

Hector Bellerin has stressed that he was right to leave Barcelona at the age of 16 to join Arsenal . Injuries have seen the Spanish defender play regularly at right back this season for the Gunners . 'I got the chance and I took it', he told Spanish paper Marca. 'Wherever you are, you have to work. If I'd stayed at Barcelona, I don't know if I'd have made it to the elite, you just never know. 'I've worked as hard as I could and always had the mentality of reaching the top. Whether I was in one place or another, I'd have done the same.' Although he knows breaking through at Barca would have been tougher than in the Premier League, Bellerin refused to accept that English football is that far behind La Liga, despite our teams' failure in the Champions League this season. Bellerin was on loan at Watford last season, but is now a Premier League regular under Arsene Wenger . 'A lot of people in Spain watch Premier League games and know what kind of a league it is, he added. 'It would be madness to say that it isn't among the best leagues in the world. 'The Spanish league is also at a very high level, with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico. In the Champions League maybe we should have done things better.

The dad-of-four was arrested and will be charged with assault, criminal mischief and harassment. Boynton was in town for Thursday's Coyotes and Sabres game a few blocks away at the First Niagara Center, the Sabres' home ice. But it looks like he won't be commentating on the game as he was placed on a leave of absence by the team following the incident. Boynton joined the Coyotes' broadcast team in July 2014 after an 11-season career as a defenseman for six teams, including Arizona, skating in a total of 605 NHL games.

The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.", "completion": "response:\n\nDraft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate  has come under fire .\nIran is seeking to double its population to 150million by 2065 .\nIt wants to restrict contraception access and prioritise jobs for the fertile .\nAmnesty says the laws will set rights of women back decades ."}

A Chinese builder was left in agony when he impaled his genitals on a steel rod.

MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged. Police and prosecutors have been criticised for arresting journalists on suspicion of a range of offences in the wake of phone-hacking allegations, rather than concentrating on terrorism, violent crime and serious fraud.

No further action was taken against 25 of the other journalists investigated.

A young mother has told how her first holiday away with her son was ruined after she discovered blood splattered on her chalet windows and mould throughout. Tierney Hinde, 28, from Dartford, Kent, was disgusted with the state of her Pontins apartment, with the nightmare starting when she discovered the dirty bed linen. Things got worse when she was offered a different room on a higher floor with blood-spattered windows at the resort in Camber, East Sussex. 'It was supposed to be the first trip with my son but it was a farce that's all I can say,' said Ms Hinde. 'I nearly cried. I don't really get like that but it was just a complete waste of time.' She chose Pontins over other resorts because the locks on the doors would provide security for autistic son Presley, four, who has a tendency to wander off. The windows were cleaned off but Tierney was still unhappy because being higher up meant more danger for Presley. As she predicted the youngster, who has poor co-ordination, fell down the landing steps, although no fault has been attributed to Pontins for this. Tierney was also disappointed by the lack of activities available for Presley. She said: 'Pontins should be getting involved with all of the kids and it wasn't like that at all. 'All he wanted to do was go towards the arcades because there was nothing else for him. 'I went there when I was 15 and nothing had changed since then and they were supposed to have had a rebirth in 2011.' Tierney Hinde became upset after discovering the bed linen was filthy in her Pontins chalet . The mould in the bathroom added to the young mum's worry, and she requested to move rooms . Tierney was so upset that she gave up on her week-long trip, which cost £500, after three days. She has since been offered 50 per cent off vouchers and VIP treatment on her next stay, but refuses to step foot in the resort again. MailOnline Travel has contacted Pontins, and is awaiting comment.

Richards is the only remaining English player in the squads of the 16 teams remaining in the Champions League and the Europa League.

Although Richards was not involved, he has featured in the Europa League this season and helped them knock out another Premier League club, Tottenham, in the round of 32. Richards, 26, had fallen out of favour under Manuel Pellegrini at City, making just 18 appearances in two seasons and decided to seek greater first-team opportunities in Florence. And while he has not been a mainstay of Vincenzo Montella's team, he has made 15 appearances across all competitions, almost certainly more than he would have made at City.

But Richards told talkSPORT on Wednesday: 'It's difficult to say [where I will play] at the moment.

On the same night as the second allegation Bird was caught urinating on a police car in public in Byron Bay. It was an incident that later cost him the co-captaincy of his side. Titans players Beau Falloon and Jamie Dowling along with Queensland Reds vice-­captain Karmichael Hunt will face Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday after they were the first footballers charged over the cocaine controversy. The buck’s party for Bird in Byron bay had several NRL players in attendance. In particular one-time Titans teammate Joe Vickery, who faces seven counts of supplying cocaine. None of Vickery’s charges relate to the time of Bird’s buck’s party.

A 28-year-old Chinese woman has set tongues wagging online after bragging of being allowed up into the cockpit of a flight. Ada Ng was able to take a video of the flight landing in Hong Kong from just behind the captain after he invited her to join him at the front of the plane. The Cathay Pacific flight was reportedly full and he wasted no time inviting the young lady into the cockpit for her return journey from Taipei to Hong Kong. According to shanghaiist.com, she posted several pictures to her page on the Chinese social networking site Weibo, gushing about how much she had enjoyed the experience of takeoff and landing. Responding to the posts,  some Weibo users expressed fears about security because most airlines have made it virtually impossible for passengers to access the cockpit post-9/11. The photos continued to circulate online despite Ms Ng subsequently removing them from her profile.

A serial thief who admitted committing more than 200 burglaries in just two years has avoided jail and been ordered to attend a ‘victim empathy course’, it was revealed today. Tomas Drungelas, 33, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was spared a prison sentence - despite victims telling the judge that they would ‘be angry’ if he was treated leniently. The Lithuanian criminal broke into and burgled 202 homes in the Hertfordshire area between 2013 and 2014 to fund his addiction to alcohol and gambling, St Albans Crown Court was told. But Judge Andrew Bright QC said that he would spare Drungelas jail and send him on a locally-run rehabilitation course called Choices and Consequences, or the ‘C2 Programme’. He also said Drungelas would be tagged for 36 months, under curfew between 9pm and 6am and must complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Drungelas was also ordered to go on the victim empathy course as well as attend alcohol and gambling ‘intervention programmes’. The judge said: ‘The victims of some of the burglaries you have committed have contacted me and expressed their anger if you were to be treated leniently. ‘Under normal circumstances you would face five or six years in prison for the offences you have committed, and many people will say that this is not the way to deal with a prolific burglar. 'However, you have been given an opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to turning your life around.' He added: ‘Some may say that this is a let off, but it is not, because if you break any of the conditions or reoffend you will find yourself back in this court and you will serve the full sentence for the crimes you have admitted to, which could be five or six years in prison.’ The C2 Programme is run by Hertfordshire Constabulary in partnership with the probation service, ‘under the direction’ of Judge Bright. It aims to turn around the lives of ‘prolific offenders’ to offer them a ‘realistic opportunity to break free from the cycle of crime’. In its first year 31 criminals took part, confessing to 1,800 crimes.

But this giant wok of ‘dragon beard’ noodles, made for 2,000 people at a temple in Henan province in central China, took it to the next level. The temple put on the incredible feast in celebration of ‘Dragon Head Raising Day’, which is marked across the country by various traditions that have been passed on down the years, reported the People's Daily Online. Everybody tuck in: The temple in Henan province offered up 'dragon beard' noodles for 2,000 people . Wait your turn: It is considered good luck to eat food named after body parts of the dragon - including 'dragon beard' noodles, 'dragon's ears' dumplings and 'dragon's scales' pancakes . Don't eat it all at once! The noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand, while symbolising longevity . Legend has it that on this day the dragon, an important symbol in Chinese culture, will awaken and bring rain to produce a bumper harvest. It is considered good luck to eat foods that are named after body parts of the dragon, including ‘dragon beard’ noodles, ‘dragon’s ears’ dumplings and ‘dragon’s scales’ pancakes. Earlier this month, chefs at the White Dragon Temple in Fucheng village used four massive woks to cook noodles for visitors that came from miles around to pray for good fortune and prosperity. Amazingly, all the food was gone within an hour. The feast on ‘Dragon Head Raising Day’, celebrated on the second day of the second lunar month, is particularly significant because it is believed to ward off diseases. The ‘dragon beard’ noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand. They symbolise longevity, which is why it is unlucky to cut them when you are eating. Just three pounds of wheat flour can be made into 144,000 hair-like noodles, according to experts.

The solitary young bird stands out from the crowd as it wanders among the large group - made up of around 200,000 penguins - at the Salisbury Plain in South Georgia, USA.

Photographer Sergei Kokinskiy travelled from his home in Tula, Russia, to capture the special moment a young chick walked into the huge colony. The 49-year-old said: 'There are certain rules when visiting this part of the island. 'For example, it is forbidden to approach penguins closer than five metres, otherwise you will frighten the birds. 'One shaggy, brown bird in the photograph is a king penguin chick. 'He waits on the banks for his parents who go to the sea to get food. Returning, the parents seek out their young among the thousands of the same brown lumps. 'Perhaps the penguin was hungry and went looking for his parents and has obviously ended up in the middle of the other older penguins. 'I love the contrast between the single brown chick and the beautiful adult birds, who look like they are dressed in their 'tuxedos'.' Baby penguins, known as woollies, keep their brown downy feathers for a year, while they develop a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm through the winter. King penguin chicks are cared for by their parents for around 40 days before they join a 'creche' for warmth and protection from predators. Their parents return occasionally during the winter to feed them. Males incubate the eggs much like Emperor penguins, but King penguins do this during the warmer summer season. The female goes to the open sea to feed and return in about 21 days so the male only goes a month without food. Change: The King Penguin chick on the right has patchy brown feathers.

He was given a suspended sentence for 18 months at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday . A Boots worker who sent a fake bomb to a store on the anniversary of the 7/7 London terror attacks has been spared jail. Ashley Parkes attached a chilling note to the rectangular package, which read: 'Handle with care - bombs explode.' Police were alerted and a store in Leeds, where the parcel was delivered last year, was evacuated until experts examined the package. They quickly discovered it was a hoax and only contained hair dye and blue tissue paper, Nottingham Crown Court was told. The 26-year-old, who worked in a Boots warehouse at the time, admitted dispatching a parcel with the intention of inducing a belief that it was likely to explode or ignite and cause personal injury or damage to property. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Michael Stokes QC , sentencing, said: 'Sending you immediately to prison would perhaps misrepresent the seriousness of what you did. 'In the present day society anybody who produces a package and even pretends it is a bomb is creating a great deal of trouble and potential risk to innocent people. 'It had been a pathetic attempt by Parkes but it still resulted in a store being evacuated and a great deal of public expense and inconvenience to a large number of people.' Julia King, prosecuting, told the court Parkes sent the hoax bomb after seeing a film on YouTube of gravestones being desecrated. She said: 'It affected him and that was why he acted in the way he did.' Ms King added that the manager had been left shocked and nervous after the incident. The Boots store in Leeds had to be evacuated and experts were called in to examine the package. Above, a stock image of a Boots store in the UK . The court heard Parkes, of Bestwood, Nottingham, has mild learning difficulties and is on medication for depression.

The 1891 painting, titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun', was largely unknown and its origin had never been verified. But a team of researchers from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland painstakingly  unearthed the signature. Scroll down for video . An 1891 oil painting - titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' - has been proven to be one of Claude Monet's despite the artist painting over his own signature . The painting has been owned by the Gösta Serlachius Fine Arts Foundation, also in Finland, for more than 50 years. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season. The painting was verified after a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature by  Monet. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet (above) with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season . Ilkka Pölönen, a researcher, said the camera scans one 'line' at a time. He told ArtDaily: 'When the camera is moved using the scanner an image of the whole picture can be obtained.' The Fine Arts Foundation said the artwork  is the first Monet painting to be held in a Finnish public collection. The other paintings from the series are held at various galleries including the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Scotland and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a non-destructive technique, which can identify the presence of certain pigments. It was first used in the 1940s and applied to paintings in the 1950s. The technique involves bombarding the artwork with x-rays so powerful that they cause atoms in the picture’s layers to emit ‘florescent’ x-rays of their own. XRF can be used to identify the colours of hidden paintings or to see earlier versions of famous pieces. By mapping the x-rays of copper, for blue and green, iron, for yellow, orange and brown, and mercury, for red, scientists can see full-colour 'maps' of previous versions. In this case a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature - verifying that the painting was by Monet.", "completion": "response:\n\nOil-painting titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' is from 1891 .\nResearchers in Finland used special technique to unearth signature ."}

Residents began calling 911 after their homes and windows began shaking from the blast at 9.45pm Saturday night.

Just say \"thank you.\" A new study published this month suggests Neanderthals were more \"cognitively advanced than we give them credit,\" Kansas University's David Frayer said in a release. Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger. Only recently, however, did Frayer identify the cut marks and notches on the 130,000-year-old bones as ones modified by humans. \"I was stunned,\" Frayer said of the discovery.  \"It's so obvious that these are cut.\" The markings, including polishes and areas where the bones were \"rubbed together,\" show that the talons were \"manipulated into a piece of jewelry,\" Frayer said. Frayer co-wrote \"Evidence for Neanderthal Jewelry: Modified White-tailed Eagle Claws at Krapina\" with three other Croatian scientists. Their research indicates Neanderthals were more than just the cavemen-like characters depicted in Geico commercials, but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an \"advanced level of prowess\" in catching birds, according to Frayer. \"We can't prove it, but we suspect that they were catching these birds,\" he said. Even with modern technology, catching an eagle is an enormously difficult thing to do.  Frayer believes Neanderthals must have had excellent \"planning skills and ritual\" they would've used in catching the bird. \"Neanderthals are often thought of to be simple-minded mumbling, bumbling, stumbling fools,\" Frayer said. \"But the more we know about them the more sophisticated they've become.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nResearchers say marking on eagle talons prove Neanderthals made jewelry .\nEagle bones used in study more than 130,000 years old .\nScientist: \"It really shows a level of technical sophistication\""}

Aswat, who is thought to be 40, was arrested in 2005 in Zambia and later flown to the UK. He fought extradition for several years and was held at Broadmoor Hospital before being sent to the US last October. In January the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case he brought against the British Government arguing that his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from US officials about his treatment. His lawyers claimed that it had breached Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

The trainer said: ‘We were disappointed with his Cheltenham run but he has come back fine. There is no reason not to run at Aintree and the tongue tie will be left off. ‘We think maybe he did not enjoy running in it even though he has plenty of experience of it being fitted at home.’ Tom Scudamore celebrates winning the A.P.

The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics – as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party’s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: ‘Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. ‘We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.’ A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘There is no truth in this allegation.’", "completion": "response:\n\nElection chief Lucy Powell planned to mingle with stars at Brits pre-party .\nBut Chief Whip Rosie Winterton ordered her to stay at Westminster for vote .\nMs Powell, 40, backed down but still made it to music awards main event .\nInsiders say row brought simmering tensions between the contrasting pair ."}

A car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Richard Burbage, 41, of Whiteley, Hampshire, then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument. The father-of-three was convicted of assault and fined £320 for attacking Julian Raffle. Burbage had been arguing with his wife, Lorraine, in KFC after they had been to a football match on a Sunday afternoon. The row erupted because Burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him. But when she discovered the meal meant being taken to KFC in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing. Dan O’Neill, prosecuting, told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row. He added that customer Mr Raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened. Mr O’Neil said there was then a struggle between Mr Raffle and Burbage - and the  car dealer twice tried to punch him. But what he did not realise was that Mr Raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu-jitsu and when Burbage tried to upper cut Mr Raffle, he used his self-defence training to dodge the blows. When the wife discovered she was going to KFC (above) in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing . Burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault. After admitting this at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, he was fined £200. He also had to pay £100 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. A separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on November 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence. Mark Rigby, defending Burbage, said: ‘He and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty, fiery and passionate. ‘What he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because Mr Raffle is trained in jiu-jitsu. ‘With hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this. She was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and wasn’t pleased to find out that that meal would be at KFC. ‘I think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife.’", "completion": "response:\n\nRichard Burbage, 41, tried to fight  martial arts expert who intervened .\nHad been arguing with wife Lorraine after they attended football match .\nFather-of-three convicted of assault and fined for attacking Julian Raffle ."}

Welcome to Nigeria's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day. They are called \"free\" because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading. Discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as Nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president. Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers. \"They are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me,\" he said. Mgbachi told CNN that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments, mostly the Premier League, and also during the election campaign period. To avoid losing out on sales too much, Mgbachi has developed an interesting business model: \"I decided not to make (reading) completely free. For some of the dailies, its 20 naira,(10 cents) 30 naira (15 cents) for the sports papers and 50 naira (30 cents) for the magazines. \"It's not really a static price, it depends on the bargaining power of the person,\" he added. Some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers. The free readers come from all walks of life and CNN spoke to analysts, an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited. They talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper. One told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer. Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet. He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers. Most of Nigeria's $70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet.", "completion": "response:\n\nMen gather around newspaper vendors to read headlines, debate issues of the day .\nCalled free readers associations because no-one actually buys the papers they read .\nDebates loud and furious as Nigerians go to the polls to choose a new president ."}

A van driver who tried to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine in wine bottles has been jailed for five years. Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, Merseyside was stopped by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, France last May and told them he had been in Belgium doing plastering and collecting solar panels. Officers found boxes containing more than 100 wine bottles in the back of Dyer's van, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The substance inside the bottles appeared oily and later checks showed the liquid tested positive for amphetamine. Dyer was arrested and checks on the van showed it had been hired in Warrington, with Dyer supplying the hire company with a false address. For previous trips he had also used hired vehicles, taking them abroad illegally. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne at street-level purity, with a potential street value of almost £8million. Last month, Dyer admitted importing controlling drugs and he was today sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne, with a potential street value of almost £8million . Matthew Rivers, from the NCA's Border Policing Command, said: 'The story Dyer told to explain his trips to the continent was a lie. Our investigation proved that in reality he was a professional courier who travelled to the Netherlands to source drugs.

The colossal sum was demanded because in Finland, fines for speeding are scaled up according to the wealth of the law-breaker – and this one, businessman Reima Kuisla, is a multi-millionaire. After he was caught travelling at 64mph in a 50mph zone, the authorities took a peek at his tax return. Reima Kuisla posted a picture of his speeding ticket on his Facebook page, complaining that the Finnish authorities were making life for the rich difficult . It showed that he earned 6.5m euros (£4.72m) a year, so they dished out a 54,000 euro fine, the Iltalehti newspaper reported. The fine has a logic to it, but Mr Kuisla complained bitterly on his Facebook page about the sum he was asked to hand over. He posted a picture of the ticket and said: ‘Finland is impossible to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and wealth. I’m considering leaving the country.’ However, sympathy levels in Finland for his plight have been fairly low. One user wrote on the Iltalehti website: ‘He should stop complaining and hang his head in shame instead.’ Earlier this week a British tourist who teaches UK police driving skills was fined for speeding in New Zealand after telling a court his father had been 'caught short' and he was taking him urgently to a toilet. Peter Lee, 46, from Kent, had been clocked at 110mph in a 60mph zone near Hokitika, south of Greymouth, on the South Island - and when he appeared before a Queenstown Court today Judge Michael Crosbie appeared surprised to learn the driver instructed UK police. 'I'm a driving instructor whose work includes teaching driving skills to serving and retiring police officers,' Lee told the court after being asked to explain his work back in England.

The 35-year-old former Lions fly-half, who retired as a player at the end of last season, is destined to act as a kicking consultant for England, according to reports in France. However, Sportsmail has learned that such an arrangement is far from a foregone conclusion. Jonny Wilkinson could return to the England set-up as a kicking consultant, according to reports in France . Wilkinson was last in action for Toulon before retiring at the end of the 2014 season .

Tinkoff-Saxo boss Oleg Tinkov had hoped the quartet would line-up in all three Grand Tours - of France, Italy and Spain. That idea did not take off, but now Tinkov has his wish of seeing the four race each other before the Tour after organisers RCS Sport announced their participation in the Italy-based Tirreno-Adriatico race, which takes place from March 11 to 17. Chris Froome celebrates on the podium after winning the 61st Tour of Andalusia on February 21, 2015 . Froome will face his main rivals for the Tour de France in Italy; one of which is Vincenzo Nibali (pictured) The prospect of 2014 Tour de France winner Nibali competing is by no means certain, though, after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, asked its licence commission to withdraw the licence of his Astana team. If Nibali does take part it will be the first time the dominant four Grand Tour winners have all raced in the same WorldTour event, RCS Sport said. Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo) is the defending champion of the 'Race of the Two Seas' and has won all three Grand Tours, as has Nibali, who won the 2012 and 2013 Tirreno-Adriatico. Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner, will lead a Team Sky squad which is also slated to include Elia Viviani. The Italian will contest the sprints against Mark Cavendish (Etixx-QuickStep) and Marcel Kittel (Team Giant-Alpecin), who has taken the Briton's mantle as the world's top sprinter in recent seasons.

The club's debts are estimated at nearly 100 million euros (£72m). The emergency fund will come from money that clubs pay to the league for fines from crowd trouble and other violations. After the league decision in Milan, Italian football federation president Carlo Tavecchio was traveling to Parma to formally present the plan to the squad's players. The plan requires Parma to play its next two matches before the bankruptcy hearing. Parma captain Alessandro Lucarelli and his club team-mates have not been paid since July .

Last month, Giampietro Manenti took over as Parma's new owner and president from the Russian-Cypriot conglomerate which had taken control in December from Ghirardi.
