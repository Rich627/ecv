Preston North End forward Kevin Davies has been through the wars during his 22 years in the beautiful game - being bumped and bruised by many an opposition defence.

Preston North End striker Kevin Davies tweeted a picture of his cut right hand after chainsawing on Tuesday . However, Davies' latest injury is self-inflicted as the England international inadvertently hacked away at his right hand while operating a chainsaw. Accompanied with the caption: 'Chainsaw 2 KD 0,' the former Bolton Wanderers captain tweeted on Tuesday a picture of his hand covered in two plasters where the damage had been done. It's the second time in less than two months where Preston's No 9 has injured that part of his body. During Preston's FA Cup fifth round replay 3-1 defeat to Manchester United on February 16, Davies managed to play over an hour after team-mate Joe Garner accidentally crushed his left hand in the opening exchanges of the contest. A day later he tweeted a picture of his injury accompanied with the caption: 'Sore hand today think my partner in crime Joe Garner landed on it!'
